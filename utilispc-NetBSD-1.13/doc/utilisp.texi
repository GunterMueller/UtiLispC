@section General Information
 
The UtiLisp32 is a new implementation of UtiLisp for Unix system.
The original UtiLisp  (University of Tokyo Interactive LISt Processor)
system  was  designed  for  highly  interactive programming and
debugging of sophisticated programs on mainframes.  
 
The new UtiLisp system is a transportation of the original UtiLisp. 
UtiLisp32 is for Unix 4.2 bsd machines whose CPU's have 32 bit address bus.
It is now available on MC68010, MC68020 and Vaxen.
This new UtiLisp is called "Unix UtiLisp" or simply "UtiLisp".

The transportation was done carefully so that the new system is compatible
to old one. However some of operating system interface functions
were not implemented or have different formats.

This  document is intended to serve both as a User's Guide and
as  a Reference Manual for the language and the system.  It is
hoped  that  those who are familiar with the Lisp language 
acquire a complete knowledge of the system from this manual.  
 
@node HowtoRun, Notation, GenInfo, Introduc
@section How to Run and Stop the System on Unix
 
UtiLisp32 on Unix is supported as Unix shell command. 
It is invoked from shell as follows:
@example
    % utilisp
@end example

Options are:
@table @code
 
@item  @code{-h} @var{size} 
     This specifies that the heap area is to be  @var{size} 
 kilo bytes.  The default heap size is 512 kilo bytes.
 
@item  @code{-ls} @var{size}
     引数スタックの大きさを @var{size} kバイトにします. 
デフォルトは32kバイトです. 

@item @code{-cs} @var{size}
     コードスタックの大きさを @var{size} kバイトにします. 
デフォルトは16kバイトです. 

@item @code{-bs} @var{size}
     束縛スタックの大きさを @var{size} kバイトにします. 
デフォルトは64kバイトです. 

@item @code{-es} @var{size}
     環境スタックの大きさを @var{size} kバイトにします. 
デフォルトは16kバイトです. 

@item @code{-m} @var{size}
     mallocで使われる領域の大きさを @var{size} kバイトにします. 
デフォルトは16kバイトです. 

@item @code{-d} @var{filename}
     @var{filename}で指定されるダンプファイルから, 立ち上げます. スタッ
ク, malloc領域の大きさは自動的にdumpfile実行時の大きさに決定されます.

@item @code{-gctype} @var{type}
  Garbage Collection(GC)のアルゴリズムを変更します. 0の時はCopying GC,
1の時はMark and Sweep GCを採用します. Mark and Sweep GCは同じヒープサイ
ズでのGC時間がCopying GCの3倍ほどかかりますが, ヒープに使用するメモリ量
が半分になるので, 大容量のメモリを必要とするプログラムでは有利になるこ
とがあります. 

@item  @code{-n} 
     This specifies that UtiLisp32 should not read and
    evaluate the file named  @code{.utilisprc}  in your home directory on
    starting up.
 
@item  @code{-F} @var{filename} 
     This specifies that UtiLisp32 should read
    and evaluate  @var{filename}  file on starting up.
@item  @code{-p} @var{size}
     This specifies the @code{extendheap-ratio}(0-100). If the size of
live cells exceeds @code{extendheap-ratio} @code{%} of heap size after
an GC, @code{extendheap} was called and heap size becomes twice as
before.

@item  @code{-E} @var{expression}
     @var{expression} is evaled as an Lisp expression on starting up.
@end table


If you have a run command file named " @code{.utilisprc} " in your home 
directory, the UtiLisp32 system will read and evaluate it first.
This evaluation is identical with that of
the  standard toplevel Lisp loop, except that the results are
not displayed. The  @code{-n}  option supresses this initial evaluation.
 
After  the  evaluation of the run command file (if any), UtiLisp32
enters  the  toplevel  loop.   Each  S-expression  read in is
evaluated  and  the  result  is displayed.  Note that the toplevel
evaluator is @code{eval}, not @code{evalquote}.  
 
The  session  is terminated by evaluating the function @code{quit}.
If  one  wishes  to  terminate  the  session  abnormally, evaluate
function @code{abend}.  
 
There  are  cases  in  which  these  system  functions are not
recognized  by  the  Lisp  reader, e.g., when the @code{readtable} or
@code{obvector}  has  been  destroyed.   In  such  cases, the UtiLisp32
session can be terminated by ten consecutive exclamation marks

@cindex exclamation mark

( @code{!!!!!!!!!!} )  at  the  beginning  of  an  input  line from the
terminal.  
 
In  case  an  endless  or unexpectedly long computation should
occur,  an  attention interrupt from the terminal (usually by
means  of interrupt) will stop the current computation and
the system enters the @code{break} loop.  For details, see
Chapter ~@pxref{ErrDebug} "Errors and Debugging".  
 
@node Notation, DataType, HowtoRun, Introduc
@section Notational Conventions and Notes on Syntax
 
There  are  several  notational conventions,  which
should  be  understood  before  reading the manual in order to
avoid confusion.  
 
In this manual,  Lisp  symbols  are  printed  in   @code{typewriter type style} .
 @var{Italic words}  appearing  in  S-expressions
represent  certain  Lisp  objects  the  details  of  which are
irrelevant  or  explained  elsewhere. 
 
In what follows, a Lisp object whose  @code{car}  is @var{a} and  @code{cdr}  is
@var{b} may sometimes be written in the form (@var{a} .  @var{b}). However,
note  that @var{a} and, especially, @var{b} are not necessarily atoms.
Thus, a list beginning with the symbol @code{progn} may be written in
the form (@code{progn}  .   @var{body}), where @var{body} is a list following
@code{progn}.   Similarly,  in  titles  of descriptions of functions,
"@code{plus} .  @var{args}",  for  example, @var{args} indicates  a list of
arguments following the function @code{plus}.  
 
Lisp  symbols  appearing  as  titles  are  followed  by a description
of its arguments. And if it is not an ordinary function, its category will be
shown in curly brackets, "{" and "}".  Specifically, the
categories  are  "Function'', "Special Form", "Macro", and "Variable".
The following   examples   illustrate  the  manner  in  which  the
arguments are described:  



@cindex quote
@code{quote} @var{arg} {Special Form}

@code{quote} is a " @code{special form} " and takes one argument.  

 
@cindex cons
@code{cons} @var{x y} {Function}

@code{cons} is an ordinary function and requires exactly two arguments,
@var{x} and @var{y}, and their absence generates an error.  

 
@cindex gensym
@code{gensym} @var{(prefix) (begin)} {Function}

@code{gensym}  may  take  zero  to  two  arguments; @var{prefix} and
@var{begin} are optional.  

 
@cindex plus
@code{plus} @var{. args} {Function}

@code{plus} may take arbitrarily many (possibly zero) arguments.

 
@cindex -
@code{-} @var{arg . args} {Function}

@code{-} may take arbitrarily many (but at least one) arguments. 



As  in the examples, argument names appear in italics
in the description of the function.  
 
The  symbol "=>"  is  used  to  indicate  evaluation in
examples,  e.g.,  "@code{foo} => @code{nil}"  means  that
"the  result of evaluating @code{foo} is @code{nil}".  
 
There  are  several terms which are widely used in this manual
but   will   not   be  rigorously  defined.   They  are:  @code{S-expression} ,
which  means  a  Lisp  object, especially in its
printed  representation;   @code{dotted pair}  
@cindex dotted pair
, which means a  @code{cons} ;
and  @code{atom}  
@cindex atom
,  which  means  a Lisp object other than a  @code{cons} .
Note  that  an atom does not necessarily mean a symbolic atom;
it may be a number, string, etc.  It is recommended that those
who  are  not familiar with these terms consult an appropriate
Lisp textbook.  
 
Several  characters  have  special  meanings in UtiLisp, i.e.,
single  quote('),  backquote( @code{`} ), 
comma( @code{,} ),semicolon( @code{;} ), and
slash( @code{/} ).
 
Semicolons  are  used  for  comments.   When  the  Lisp reader
encounters   a   semicolon,  it  ignores  all  the  characters
remaining  on  the  current  line and resumes reading from the
beginning  of the next line.  In such a case, a blank space is
automatically introduced between the last symbol preceding the
semicolon  and  the first symbol on the next line.  However, a
semicolon  may occur as an element of a string (see remarks on
double quotes below).  
 
A  single  quote ' has the same effect as the special form
@code{quote}(see below).  For example, \sexpr{'foo} is read as
(quote foo),
and  \sexpr{'(cons  'foo  'bar)} is  read as
(quote (cons (quote foo) (quote bar))), etc.  
 
Slashes  are  used  for  escaping  characters possessing special
functions  so  that  they  are  merely  interpreted  as normal
alphabetic characters.  For example, \sexpr{/'foo} is read as a symbol
whose  print name is \sexpr{"'foo"} and not as "(quote foo)".  Thus, 
one must type " @code{//} " to convey the symbol " @code{/} " to the Lisp reader.  
 
Double quotes are used for indicating strings.  Any characters
occurring between a double quote and the next double quote are
read  as  a  string.   Double  quotes occurring inside strings
should  be typed twice.  For example,  @code{""""}  represents a string
consisting  of  one  double quote.  A string may extend beyond
the ends of a line.  
 
Concerning backquotes and commas, see Chapter ~@pxref{Macros} "Macros".  
 
@node DataType, LambdaLs, Notation, Introduc
@section Data Types
 
There  are ten data types 
@cindex data type
 in UtiLisp32, 
i.e.,  @code{symbol} ,  @code{cons} ,
 @code{fixnum} ,  @code{bignum} ,  @code{flonum} ,  @code{string} ,  @code{vector} , 
 @code{reference} ,  @code{stream} , and  @code{code piece} .  
 
A  @code{symbol} has a  @code{print name} , 
@cindex print name

a  @code{value}  
@cindex value
 (sometimes called a
 @code{binding}  
@cindex binding
),  a  @code{definition} , 
@cindex definition

and  a  @code{property list}  
@cindex property list
.
The  @code{print name} 
is  a  string  which is the value of the function @code{pname}
when  applied to the symbol in question; this string serves as
the  
@cindex printed representation
 of the symbol.  The  @code{value}  may be
any Lisp object, and is interpreted as the value of the symbol
when the  @code{symbol}  is used as a variable.  The symbol may also be
in  @code{unbound}  
@cindex unbound
  state,  in  which case, it has no value at all.
Access to the value of a symbol is effected by evaluating the
symbol, and the value may be updated by using the functions
@code{set} and @code{setq}. The  @code{definition}  is functional attribute of 
the symbol; access is effected by @code{getd} and updating by @code{putd} or 
@code{defun}.  The  @code{property list}  contains  an  even  number(possibly zero)
of elements; direct  access  and  updating  are  effected  by 
@code{plist} and @code{setplist}, respectively,  but it is usually more 
convenient to use  the  functions  @code{get} (for access), @code{putprop} (for 
adding and updating  properties),  and @code{remprop} (for removing properties).
@code{symbol} is the basic function for creating a new symbol with a
certain  print  name.   All symbols which are normally read in
are  registered in a table called  @code{obvector}  
@cindex obvector
,
and any of these
which  bear  the  same  name  are  identified  by means of the
function @code{intern} (for  details,  see  Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut}, "Input and
Output").   The  function @code{gensym} serves to generate a sequence
of distinct symbols.  
 
A  @code{cons}  is a Lisp object possessing two components,  @code{car}  and
 @code{cdr} ,  which  may  be  any Lisp objects.  Access to these two
components   is   effected  by  the  functions @code{car} and @code{cdr},
respectively, and updating by @code{rplaca} and @code{rplacd}, respectively.
A  @code{cons}  may be constructed by means of the function @code{cons}.  
 
There are three kinds of numerical objects 
@cindex numerical object

in this system, upon
which arithmetical operations may be performed; one is 
 @code{fixnum}   which  possesses  28-bit  signed  integer value.
 @code{Bignum}  is an  @code{integer}  
@cindex integer
 of arbitrary length. Both  @code{fixnum}  and
 @code{bignum}  are categorized as integers. Most of arithmetic functions convert
the type between the two automatically.
The other is   @code{flonum}  which possesses 64-bit floating point
value. The 
@cindex accuracy
 is about 15 decimal digits in MC68000 series
and 17 decimal digits in Vax.  
 
A  @code{string}  
@cindex string
 is a finite(possibly zero) sequence of 

@cindex character
.  Each 
character has an 8-bit code value which is usually interpreted in terms
of the ASCII code. Independent access to and updating of
these  characters are effected by means of the functions
@code{sref} and @code{sset}, respectively. The length of a string may be known
by applying the function @code{string-length}.  
 
A  @code{vector}  
@cindex vector
 is a finite(possibly zero) ordered set of Lisp objects.  
Vectors are  created  by means of the function @code{vector}.  
Access to the vector element is effected by
means  of the function @code{vref} and updating by the function @code{vset}.
The  length  of a vector may be known by applying the function
@code{vector-length}.
 
A  @code{reference}  
@cindex reference
 is  a pointer indicating an element of a vector.
It  is  often  useful to have access to and update elements of
vectors. A reference   is  created  by  the  function
@code{reference}; access to and updating of the corresponding element
can  be  effected  by means of the functions @code{deref} and @code{setref},
respectively.  
 
A  @code{stream}  
@cindex stream
 is an object related to I/O.  All the 
@cindex I/O operations

in  this  system are carried out by means of such intermediary
streams, which are created by the function @code{stream}.  
 
A  @code{code piece}  
@cindex code piece
 is a segment of machine code which constitutes
the  body of a predefined or compiled functions.  Code pieces
have names, normally a symbol, access to which is effected
by means of the function @code{funcname}.  
 
@node LambdaLs, , DataType, Introduc
@section Lambda Lists
 
A @code{lambda}-expression  is  the format specifying an interpreted
function in Lisp, and is of the form 
@example
     (@code{lambda} @var{lambda-list . body})
@end example
where  @var{body} is a list of forms.  Usually, @var{lambda-list} is a
list  of  symbols  which  corresponds  to the so-called formal
parameter list in certain other programming languages.When a
@code{lambda}-expression  is applied to given values of the argument
 
@cindex argument

(actual  parameters),  the  symbols are bound to these values,
and  the  forms constituting @var{body} are evaluated sequentially
and the result of the last of these evaluations becomes
the  final  result  of the application.  The formal parameters
are  then  unbound  and the state is restored to that of preapplication.
If  the  number of actual arguments is not
equal to the length of @var{lambda-list}, an error is generated.  
 
In UtiLisp32, an element of @var{lambda-list} may be either a symbol
or a list of the form 
@example
     (@var{symbol . defaults})
@end example
When  the  number of actual arguments to which the function is
applied  is  less  than the length of @var{lambda-list}, the given
actual arguments are first bound to the corresponding symbols.
The  remaining  elements  of  @var{lambda-list} must have the list form
(@var{symbol . defaults}). Here, @var{defaults} 
@cindex default

is a list of forms
which  are  evaluated  sequentially and the result of the last
one  (or @code{nil} in the case when @var{defaults} is empty) is bound to
@var{symbol}.   If  an  actual  argument corresponding to a symbol
associated with a list @var{defaults} is given, then the symbol
is  bound  to  this  actual  argument  and the associated list
@var{defaults} is merely ignored.  
 
Default   values  are  evaluated  after  the  binding  of  the
preceding  arguments,  hence, they may depend upon the results
of the preceding bindings.  
 
Examples of lambda-lists:  

@table @code
 
@item  @code{(a b c)} 
  actual parameters for @code{a}, @code{b}, and @code{c} are all required.  
 
@item  @code{(a b (c))} 
  @code{a} and @code{b} are required but @code{c}
 is optional; the default value of @code{c} is @code{nil}.  
 
@item  @code{(a b (c 0))} 
 @code{a} and @code{b} are required but @code{c} is
 optional; the default value of @code{c} is 0.  
 
@item  @code{(a b (c (print "Default value is used for C.") 0))} 
 @code{a} and
 @code{b} are required and @code{c} is optional; when the default value is used,
 the indicated message is printed.  
 
@item  @code{(a b (c (cons a b)))} 
 @code{a} and @code{b} are required and
 @code{c} is
 optional; the default value of @code{c} depends upon @code{a} and @code{b}.

@end menu

A predicate is a function which tests the validity of some
condition involving its arguments and returns the symbol @code{t} if
the condition holds, and the symbol @code{nil} otherwise.  
 
When  a  Lisp  object  is  used  as  a  logical  value,  it is
interpreted  as  @code{false} if  and  only if it is @code{nil}; all Lisp
objects other than @code{nil} are interpreted as  @code{true}.  
 
@node PredonDT, GenPurPd, , Predicat
@section Predicates on Data Types
 
The  following  predicates  are for testing data types.  These
predicates  return @code{t} if its argument is of the type indicated
by the name of the function, @code{nil} if it is of some other type. 



@cindex symbolp
@code{symbolp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{symbolp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{symbol} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  


@cindex consp
@code{consp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{consp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{cons} ; otherwise @code{nil}.  


@cindex listp
@code{listp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{listp} is equivalent to @code{consp}.  This is incorporated mainly
for compatibility with other Lisp systems.  


@cindex atom
@code{atom} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{atom} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is not a  @code{cons} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  


@cindex fixp
@code{fixp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{fixp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{fixnum}  object, i.e.,
a small integer number; otherwise @code{nil}.  


@cindex bigp
@code{bigp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{bigp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{bignum}  object, i.e.,
a big integer number; otherwise @code{nil}.  


@cindex integerp
@code{integerp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{integerp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{fixnum}  or a
 @code{bignum} , i.e., an integer number; otherwise @code{nil}.  


@cindex floatp
@code{floatp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{floatp} returns @code{t} if  @var{arg}  is  a   @code{flonum}   object, 
i.e., a floating-point number; otherwise @code{nil}.  


@cindex numberp
@code{numberp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{numberp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{fixnum} , a  @code{bignum} 
or a  @code{flonum} , i.e., a numerical object; otherwice @code{nil}.


@cindex stringp
@code{stringp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{stringp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{string} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  

 
@cindex vectorp
@code{vectorp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{vectorp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{vector} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  

 
@cindex referencep
@code{referencep} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{referencep} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{reference}  pointer;
otherwise @code{nil}.

 
@cindex streamp
@code{streamp} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{streamp} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{stream} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  

 
@cindex codep
@code{codep} @var{arg} {Function}

@code{codep} returns @code{t} if @var{arg} is a  @code{code piece} ; otherwise
@code{nil}.  

 
@node GenPurPd, , PredonDT, Predicat
@section General Purpose Predicates

The   following  functions  are  some  other  general  purpose
predicates.  


 
@cindex eq
@code{eq} @var{x y} {Function}

@code{eq} returns @code{t} if  @var{x}  and @var{y} denote the same Lisp object;
otherwise  @code{nil}.  Lisp objects which have the same printed
representations  are  not necessarily identical.  However,
the  @code{interning}  process ensures that two symbols with the
same  print  name  are  identical  (see  Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut} "Input and
Output", for
details).   Unlike  some  other Lisp systems, equality of
values of small integer numbers ( @code{fixnums} )  may  also  be
compared using @code{eq}.  

Note:   In  this manual, the expression "two Lisp objects
are @code{eq}" means that they are the same object.  

 
@cindex neq
@code{neq} @var{x y} {Function}

(@code{neq} @var{x y}) is equivalent to (@code{not} (@code{eq} @var{x y}))
     

 
@cindex equal
@code{equal} @var{x y} {Function}

@code{equal} returns @code{t} if @var{x} and @var{y} are "similar" Lisp
objects;  otherwise  @code{nil}.  That is, two strings are @code{equal}
if  they  have  the same length and all the characters in
corresponding  positions  are the same, two  @code{bignums}  are
@code{equal} if they have the same integer value, two  @code{flonums}  are
@code{equal}  if  they  have the same floating-point value, 
two @code{vectors} @code{equal} if their size is same and all their contents 
are @code{eq}, and two  @code{cons}   cells  are  @code{equal}  if  their
respective  @code{cars}  and   @code{cdrs}  are @code{equal} inductively.
In all other cases, two objects are @code{equal} if and only if they are 
@code{eq}. 

If two Lisp objects are @code{equal}, they have the same printed
representation, however, the reverse does not necessarily
hold (e.g., for symbols which have not been "interned"). 

 
@cindex not
@code{not} @var{x} {Function}

@cindex null
@code{null} @var{x} {Function}

@code{not} returns the symbol @code{t} if @var{x} is @code{eq} to @code{nil};
the symbol  @code{nil}  otherwise. @code{null} is equivalent to @code{not};
both functions  are  incorporated for the sake of readability.
It  is recommended that @code{null} is used for checking whether
a  given value is @code{nil}, and that @code{not} be used for inverting
a logical value.  


UtiLisp32  also  includes  various predicates in addition to
those  introduced in this chapter.  These will be described in
the  chapters  on  the  various  data  types accepted by these
predicates;  for  example, the predicate @code{zerop} is described in
Chapter ~@pxref{Numbers}, "Numbers".

@section The Evaluator
 
The process of evaluation of a Lisp form is as follows:  
 
If the form is neither a  @code{symbol}  nor a  @code{cons} , i.e., if it is a
 @code{fixnum} , a   @code{bignum} , a  @code{flonum} , a  @code{string} ,
a  @code{code piece} , a  @code{vector} , a  @code{reference}  or a  @code{stream} ,
then the result of its evaluation is simply the form itself.  
 
If the form is a  @code{symbol} , then the result is the value to which
that  @code{symbol}  is bound.  If the symbol is unbound, an error is
generated.  
 
A  so-called @code{special form} (i.e., a  @code{cons}  identified by a
distinguished  symbol  in  its  @code{car} ) is evaluated in a manner
which  depends  upon  the particular form in question.  All of
these   @code{special  forms}   will  be individually described in this
manual.  
 
If  the  form  in  question is not a so-called  @code{special form} ,
then  it  requires the application of a function or a macro to
its  arguments.   The  @code{car}  of the form is a @code{lambda}-expression
or  the name of a function.  If the function is not a  @code{macro} ,
the   @code{cdr}   of the form is a list of forms which are evaluated
sequentially,  from left to right, and the resulting arguments

@cindex argument

are  then supplied to the function; the value finally returned
is the result of applying the function to these arguments.  
 
The evaluation process for macro forms is described in Chapter
~@pxref{Macros}, "Macros".  
 
A more detailed and accurate description of the evaluator will
be given after various improvements of present
implementation have been carried out.  
 
@node Various Functions Concerned with Evaluation, , TheEval, Evaluate
@section Various Functions Concerned with Evaluation


@cindex eval
@code{eval} @var{x} {Function}

@code{eval} evaluates  @var{x}, and returns the result.  Ordinarily, @code{eval}
is not often used explicitly, since evaluation is usually
carried  out  implicitly.   @code{eval}  is  primarily useful in
programs  concerning  Lisp  itself,  rather  than  in its applications.  

 
@cindex apply
@code{apply} @var{fn arglist} {Function}

@code{apply} applies  the  function @var{fn} to the set of arguments given
by @var{arglist}, and returns the resulting value.  

 
@cindex funcall
@code{funcall} @var{fn . args} {Function}

@code{funcall} applies the function @var{fn} to the set of arguments
@var{args}, and   returns   the   resulting  value.   Note  that  the
functional  argument  @var{fn} is evaluated in the usual way,
while function which constitutes the  @code{car}  of an ordinary
Lisp application is not.  

     Example: s
@example
       (setq cons 'plus) => plus
       (funcall cons 1 2) =>  3
       (cons 1 2) => (1 . 2)
@end example
 
     Thus,  explicit  application  using  @code{funcall},  instead of
     simple  implicit function application, should be used for
     functional  arguments, since, the binding of the function
     is  not  examined  by  the  evaluator  in simple implicit
     function  applications, whereas when @code{funcall} is used, the
     functional argument symbol is evaluated first, yielding a
     function which is then applied in the ordinary manner.  

 
@cindex quote
@code{quote} @var{arg} {Special Form}

@code{quote} simply returns  the  argument  @var{arg}.   Its  usefulness
largely  consists  in  the  fact that its argument is not
evaluated by the evaluator.  

     Example: s
@example
       (quote x) => x
       (setq x (quote (cons 1 2))) => (cons 1 2)
       x => (cons 1 2)
@end example

Since  @code{quote}  is  very  frequently  used, the Lisp reader
allows  the  user  to  reduce the burden of keying in the
program  by converting S-expressions preceded by a single
quote character "\sexpr{'}" into @code{quote}d forms.  For example, 
@example
          (setq x '(cons 1 2))
@end example
     is converted into 
@example
          (setq x (quote (cons 1 2)))
@end example

 
@cindex function
@code{function} @var{fn} {Special Form}

The  form  (function @var{x}) has precisely the same effect as
(quote @var{x}); these alternative forms are available for the
sake  of  clarity in reading and writing programs.  It is
recommended  that  @code{function} be used to quote a piece of a
program,  and  that  @code{quote}  be used for segments of data.
The   compiler  utilizes  this  information  to  generate
efficient object codes.  
 
Note:  Function-valued arguments in Lisp functions should
be  evoked using @code{funcall}.  See the description of @code{funcall}
(above) for details.  

 
@cindex comment
@code{comment} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

@code{comment} ignores its arguments and always returns @code{nil}; it
is useful for inserting explanatory remarks.  

 
@cindex progn
@code{progn} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

The  arguments  @var{args}  are  evaluated sequentially, from
left  to  right,  and  the value of the final argument is
returned.   This operation is useful in cases where it is
necessary  to  evaluate a number of forms for the sake of
the  concomitant  side  effects but only the value of the
last  form  is  required.   Note that @code{lambda}-expressions,
@code{cond}  forms,  and  many  other  control  structure  forms
incorporate  this  property  of  @code{progn} implicitly (in the
sense  that  multiple  forms  are  handled  in  a similar
manner).  

 
@cindex prog1
@code{prog1} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

@code{prog1} functions in the same manner as @code{progn}, except that
it  returns  the  value of the first argument rather than
the  last.   @code{prog1}  is  most  commonly used to evaluate a
number  of  expressions,  with possible occurrence of the
side  effects,  and return a value which must be computed
before the side effect 
@cindex side effect
 occur.  

     Example: 
@example
           (setq x (prog1 y (setq y x)))
@end example
 
This  form interchanges the values of the variables @code{x} and @code{y}.  


@cindex prog2
@code{prog2} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

The  action  of  @code{prog2}  is  the same as that of @code{progn} and
@code{prog1},  except  that  it  returns the value of its second
argument.   It  is  incorporated mainly for compatibility
with other Lisp systems.  
@example
         (prog2 @var{x y} . @var{z})
@end example
     is equivalent to
@example
         (progn @var{x} (prog1 @var{y} . @var{z}))
@end example


@cindex let
@code{let} @var{bindings . body} {Macro}

A @code{let} form has the syntax:

@example
           (let ((@var{var1 vform1})
                 (@var{var2 vform2})
                 @dots{})
	   (l
             @var{bform1}
             @var{bform2}
             @dots{})
@end example
     which  is  automatically  converted  into and effectively
     equivalent to the following form:  
@example
           ((lambda (@var{var1 var2} @dots{})
	   ((lam
             @var{bform1}
             @var{bform2}
             @dots{})
	   (
	   @var{vform1}
	   @var{vform2}
           @dots{})
@end example
     It is often preferable to use @code{let} rather than to directly
     use  @code{lambda},  since  the  variables and the corresponding
     forms  appear  textually  close  to  one  another,  which
     increases the readability of the program.  
 
     As @code{let} forms are converted into @code{lambda} application forms,
     all  the  values  of  the  @var{vform}'s  are computed before
     binding  any  of  these  values  to the corresponding
     @var{var}'s.    For  example,  @var{vform2}  cannot  depend  upon
     @var{var1},  that  is,  if @var{var1} appears in @var{vform2}, then a
     variable  named  @var{var1}  must  have  been bound somewhere
     outside this @code{let} form.  


@cindex lets
@code{lets} @var{bindings . body} {Macro}

     @code{lets}  is  similar to @code{let} except that @code{lets}  binds its
     variables   sequentially,  one  by  one,  while  @code{let},  as
     mentioned   above,  binds  them  at  once.   (@code{lets}  is  a
     contraction of "let Sequentially").  
 
     A @code{lets} form has the syntax: 
@example
           (lets ((@var{var1 . vforms1})
                 (@var{var2 . vforms2})
                 @dots{})
	   (l
             @var{bform1}
             @var{bform2}
             @dots{})
@end example
     which is effectively equivalent to:  
@example
           ((lambda ((@var{var1 . vforms1})
                     (@var{var2 . vforms2})
                     @dots{})
	   ((lam
                @var{bform1}
                @var{bform2}
                @dots{}))
@end example
     each  list  @var{vforms-i}  constitutes the default value list
     for  the  corresponding @var{var-i}, and therefore can depend
     upon  the  preceding  @var{var}'s  (see  Section 1.5, "Lambda
     Lists", for details).  
 
     Note:   The interpretation of @code{lets} is faster than that of
     @code{let}.    However,   once  compiled,  their  speeds  become
     identical.

* NonLExit:: Non-local Exits
* Mapping:: Mapping
@end menu
 
The  present  system  provides a variety of structures for the
flow of control.  
 
Functional application 
@cindex function  application
  is  the 
basic  method for constructing
programs.   Moreover,  the definition of a function may always
call  the  function  being  defined.  This process is known as
"recursion".  
 
Both  explicit  and  implicit @code{progn} structures may be used for
sequential  execution  of  programs.   The  forms  in  a @code{progn}
structure are evaluated sequentially from left to right.  
 
In  this  chapter,  some even more flexible
control  structures are described.   Conditional  constructs  are useful for
making  decisions,  while iteration and mapping constructs

@cindex mapping construct
 may
be  convenient  for  repetition.  There are also more flexible
control structures known as non-local exits.  
 
@node Conditio, Iterate, , FlowCont
@section Conditionals
 
A  conditional construct incorporates a decision in a program,
resulting  in  the execution of one of several alternatives in
accordance with certain logical conditions.  


 
@cindex and
@code{and} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

@code{and} evaluates the arguments sequentially, from left to right.
If the value of some argument is @code{nil}, then @code{nil} is returned
and  the  remaining  arguments are not evaluated.  If the
value of all the arguments are non-@code{nil} 
@cindex non-nil
,
then the value of
the  last  argument  is returned.  @code{and} can be interpreted
for  logical  operation, where @code{nil} stands for  @code{false}  and
non-@code{nil} for  @code{true} .  

     Example: s
@example
        (and x y)
        (and (setq temp (assq x y))
             (rplacd temp z))
        (and error-exists (princ "There is an error!"))
@end example
 
     Note:  (and) => \sexpr{t}

 
@cindex or
@code{or} @var{ . args} {Special Form}

@code{or} evaluates the arguments sequentially, from left to right.
If the value of some argument is @code{nil}, the next argument is
evaluated.  If there are no remaining arguments, then @code{nil}
is  returned.   However,  if the value of some argument is
non-@code{nil},  then that value is immediately returned and the
remaining  arguments,  if any, are not evaluated.  @code{or} can
be  interpreted  as a logical operation, where @code{nil} stands
for  @code{false}  and non-@code{nil} for  @code{true} .  
 
     Note:  (or) => \sexpr{nil}

 
@cindex cond
@code{cond} @var{ . clauses} {Special Form}

The   arguments  of  @code{cond}  are  usually  referred  to  as
"clauses".   Each clause consists of a predicate followed
by  a  number (possibly zero) of forms.  The predicate is
called  the  "antecedent"  and  the  forms are called the
"consequents".  

Thus, a @code{cond}-form might have the following syntax:  
@example
  (cond (@var{antecedent consequent consequent} @dots{})
        (@var{antecedent})
        (@var{antecedent consequent} @dots{})
        @dots{})
@end example
 
     Each  clause  represents an alternative which is selected
     if its @var{antecedent} is satisfied and the @var{antecedent}s of all
     preceding clauses were not satisfied when evaluated.  
 
     The  clauses  are  processed  sequentially  from  left to
     right.   First,  the  @var{antecedent} of the current clause is
     evaluated.  If the result is @code{nil}, the process advances to
     the   next   clause.    Otherwise,  the  @var{consequent}s  are
     evaluated  sequentially  from  left  to right (in a  @code{progn} 
     manner),  the  value  of the last consequent is returned,
     and the remaining clauses (if any) are not processed.  If
     there  were  no  @var{consequent}s in the selected clause, then
     the  value of the @var{antecedent} is returned.  If the clauses
     are  exhausted, that is, the value of every @var{antecedent} is
     @code{nil}, then the value of the @code{cond} form is @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex selectq
@code{selectq} @var{key-form . clauses} {Special Form}

Many  programs  require multiplex branchings which depend
on  the  value  of  some  form.   A typical example is as
follows:  
@example
  (cond ((eq x 'foo) @dots{})
        ((eq x 'bar) @dots{})
        ((memq x '(baz quux mum)) @dots{})
        (t @dots{}))
@end example
 
@code{selectq}   is   incorporated   for   convenience  in  such
situations.  A @code{selectq} form has the following syntax:  
@example
  (selectq  @var{key-form}
      (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
      (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
      (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
      @dots{})
@end example
The  first  argument  @var{key-form} is evaluated first (only
once).  The resulting value is called the @code{key}.  The @var{key-form}
is followed by a number of  @code{cluases}  
@cindex clause
, each of which
consists  of  a  @var{pattern} followed by a number (possibly
zero)  of @var{consequent} forms 
@cindex consequent form
. 
The @var{pattern} 
@cindex pattern
 of each clause
is  compared  with  the  key,  and  if  it "matches" 
@cindex match
, the
@var{consequent}s  of  this  clause  are evaluated, and @code{selectq}
returns  the  value of the last @var{consequent}.  If there are
no  "matches",  or  if  there  is  no  @var{consequent}  in the
selected  clause,  then  @code{nil}  is returned.  Note that the
@var{pattern}s are not evaluated.  
 
The  objects  which may be used as the @var{pattern}s and their
"matching" conditions are as follows:  
@enumerate
      
@item
 Any atom (symbol, number, etc.), except the symbol @code{t}
          The  key matches if it is @code{eq} to the
          atom.  
      
@item
 A list
          The key matches if it is @code{eq} to one of
          the top-level elements of the list.  
      
@item
 The symbol @code{t} 
          The  symbol  @code{t}  constitutes  a special pattern which
          matches anything.  
@end enumerate
 
     Example:  The preceding example  is  expressed with  @code{selectq}  as follows:
@example
         (selectq x
         (sel
             (foo @dots{})
             (bar @dots{})
             ((baz quux mum) @dots{})
             (t @dots{}))
@end example
 
Note:   The  symbol  @code{t}  itself  may  be used as the first
component  of  a  clause,  in  a  non-trivial  manner, by
selecting (t) as the pattern.  

 
@cindex match
@code{match} @var{key-form . clauses} {Special Form}

@code{match} is a special form for pattern matching. A @code{match} form has the
following syntax:

@example
  (match @var{key-form}
         (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
         (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
         (@var{pattern consequent consequent} @dots{})
         @dots{})
@end example
The first argument @var{key-form} is evaluated first (only once). The 
resulting value is called the @code{key}. The @var{key-form} is followed by
a number of  @code{clauses}  
@cindex clause
, each of which 
consists of a @var{pattern}
followed by a number (possibly zero) of @var{consequent} forms

@cindex consequent forms
. The 
@var{pattern} of each clause is compared with the @var{key}, and if it 
"matches", the @var{consequents} of this clause are evaluated, and 
@code{match} returns the value of the last @var{consequent}. If ther are no
"matches", or if there is no @var{consequent} in the selected clause,
then @code{nil} is returned. Note that the @var{patterns} are not evaluated.

The Objects which may be used as the @var{pattern} and their "matching"
conditions are as follows:
@enumerate

@item
 @code{nil}
The @var{key} matches if it is @code{nil}.

@item
 Any symbol except the symbol @code{nil}
The @var{key} matches any symbol, and the symbol is @code{lambda}-bound
to the @var{key}. The binding is unbound when the pattern matching 
fails. When the matching succeeds, the binding is kept during the 
evaluation of the clause and is unbound immediately before the evaluation
ot the @code{match} form.

@item
 non symbolic atom
The @var{key} matches if it is @code{eq} the atom.

@item
 ( @code{quote}  S-expression)
The @var{key} matches if it is @code{eq} the S-expression.

@item
  @code{cons}  other than 4
The @var{key} matches if its  @code{car}  "matches" the  @code{car} 
of the @var{pattern} and its  @code{cdr}  "matches" the  @code{cdr}  of the pattern.
@end enumerate
Example: s To return the S-expression if what is read in is of the form
(@code{quote} S-expression); the first element if it is a list; @code{nil}
for all other cases:
@example
	(match (read)
	  (('quote sexpr) sexpr)
	  ((top . rest) top))
@end example

The same program would become with @code{cond} form as follows:
@example
	(lets ((x (read)))
	  (cond ((atom x) nil)
	        ((and (eq (car x) 'quote)
	              (consp (cdr x))
	              (null (cddr x)))
	        (cadr x))
	        (t (car x))))
@end example

Function copy is realized with  @code{match}  as follows:
@example
	(match x
	  ((head . tail) (cons (copy head) (copy tail)))
	  (x x))
@end example
Note: When the some variables appear more than twice in @var{pattern},
consistency of the parts correspond to the same pattern would not be checked.
The variable is @code{lambda}-bound by the last corresponding part.

@section Iteration
 

@cindex prog
@code{prog} @var{locals . body} {Special Form}

     @code{prog}   is   a   special  form  which  provides temporary variables
     
@cindex temporary variable
, 
     sequential  evaluation  of  forms, and  @code{goto} 
     operations.  A typical @code{prog} form might have, for example,
     the following structure:  
@example
         (prog (@var{var1}
	        (@var{var2 . inits2})
	        @var{var3}
	        (@var{var4 . inits4}))
         @var{tag1} @var{statement1}
                     @var{statement2}
         @var{tag2} @var{statement3}
                     @dots{})
@end example
     @var{var1},  @var{var2},  @dots{} are  temporarily bound variables.
     The  binding of these variables prior to the execution of
     the @code{prog} are saved, and when the execution of the @code{prog}
     has  been  completed, the original bindings are restored.
     If  a  variable  is associated with an initial value list
     @var{inits},  then  the  elements  of  the list are evaluated
     sequentially,  from  left  to right, and the value of the
     last  one  becomes the initial value of the variable.  If
     there  are  no  initial value forms, then the variable is
     initialized to @code{nil}.  
 
     Example: 
@example
        (prog ((a t)
               b
               (c (print "c is bound")
	          (car '(foo . bar))))
               @var{. body})
@end example
     Here, the initial value of @code{a} is @code{t}, that of @code{b} is
     @code{nil}, and that  of @code{c} is the symbol @code{foo}.
     Before the binding of @code{c} is
     executed, the indicated message is printed.  The bindings
     are  processed  sequentially,  and the value of each form
     may depend upon previous bindings.  
 
     The  portion of a @code{prog} which follows the variable list is
     called  the @code{body}.  The elements of @var{body} may be atoms,
     which  are  called  @code{tag}s,  or   @code{cons}   cells, which are
     called @code{statement}s. 
 
     After  the temporary variables have been bound, the forms
     in  the  @var{body}  are  processed sequentially.  @var{Tag}s are not
     evaluated,  whereas  @var{statement}s  are  evaluated and their
     values  discarded.   If  process  reaches  the end of the
     @var{body}, then @code{nil} is returned.  However, two special devices
     (described  below)  may  be  used  to  alter  the flow of
     control in the @var{body} of a @code{prog}.  
 
     When
@example
	(return @var{$x_1$} @dots{}  @var{$x_n$})
@end example
     is evaluated, then processing of
     the @var{body} is terminated and the value of the last argument
     @var{$x_n$} is returned as the value of the @code{prog} form.  If @var{n}=0, i.e.,
     if no arguments are present, then the value returned will
     be   @code{nil}.    Only   those  @code{return}  statements  which  are
     explicitly  included  in  the  body  of  a  @code{prog} form should
     legitimately  be used  in this manner (for example, a @code{return}
     statement  occurring  within the definition of a function
     called  during  the  execution of a @code{prog} will generate an
     error when the program is compiled.) 
 
     When
@example
	(go @var{tag})
@end example
     is evaluated, then the evaluation process is
     resumed  from  the statement labelled with @var{tag} (in case
     there  is  no statement associated with @var{tag}, i.e., when
     @var{tag}  is  at the end of a @code{prog} body, the @code{prog} routine is
     simply terminated); @var{tag} is not evaluated.  If the label
     @var{tag}  does  not  occur  in  the  body  of  the @code{prog} form
     currently  being executed, the body of the innermost @code{prog}
     form  properly including the current one is searched, and
     so  forth; if @var{tag} is found, then the execution sequence
     leaves the current @code{prog} form and the program execution is
     resumed from the point labelled with @var{tag}.  If the label
     @var{tag}  does not occur in any @code{prog} form which contains
     (go @var{tag}), then an error is generated. Any statement of the
     form (go @var{tag}) must explicitly be included in the @code{prog}
     form containing the destination indicated by @var{tag}.  


@cindex go
@code{go} @var{tag} {Special Form}

See the explanation under the entry for @code{prog} above.  

Note:   @var{tag}  may  be  an  atom  of  any  type including
 @code{symbols}  or   @code{fixnums} .   Since  the  process  of
searching  is  effected  using the equality criterion @code{eq},  @code{bignum} ,
 @code{flonums} ,  @code{strings} ,  @code{vectors} ,  etc. are  generally not
appropriate as labels.  

 
@cindex return
@code{return} @var{. args} {Function}

See the explanation under the entry for @code{prog} above.  

 
@cindex loop
@code{loop} @var{. body} {Special Form}

     @code{loop}  is  a   @code{special form}  used for simple iteration.  The
     arguments of @code{loop} are evaluated sequentially from left to
     right.   As  long  as  @code{exit}  is  not  evoked during these
     evaluations,   this  process  is  interminably  repeated.
     However,  if  an @code{exit} form is encountered, the inner-most
     @code{loop}  containing  it  is  terminated and the value of the
     last  argument  of  this @code{exit} is returned as the value of
     that @code{loop} form.  

     Example:  The  top-level  loop  of  UtiLisp32, although
     actually defined in terms of machine language, could have
     been defined as follows:
@example
           (loop (print (eval (read))))
@end example


@cindex exit
@code{exit} @var{. args} {Function}

     See the explanation under the entry for @code{loop} above.  @code{exit}
     being  an  ordinary function, its arguments are evaluated
     sequentially, from left to right, in the usual manner.  
 
     When  a  @code{loop}  form  is to be compiled, the corresponding
     @code{exit} forms must be explicitly contained in the @code{loop}.  


@cindex do
@code{do} @var{index-part exit-part . body} {Macro}

@code{do}  is  a  control form which facilitates iteration using
so-called   @code{index variables}  
@cindex index variable
. The first argument
@var{index-part} is a list, the elements of which have the form 
@example
  (@var{var init next})
@end example
 
where  @var{var}  is  a symbol employed as an index variable,
@var{init} is the initial value assigned to @var{var}, and @var{next}
is  a  form  which  is  computed  after  each  iteration,
whereupon the resulting value is assigned to @var{var}.  
 
The  initial  values  are computed sequentially, and only
after  this  process  is  completed are they bound to the
corresponding  variables;  the same applies to subsequent
assignments arising from the @var{next} forms.  
 
The second argument @var{exit-part} has the syntax as 
@example
  (@var{end-test . exit-forms})
@end example
 
After  initially  binding  the index variables, and after
each  round  of  @var{next} value updating, the form @var{end-test} 
is  evaluated.   If  the  result  is  non-@code{nil}, the
termination  process  begins;  the forms constituting the
list  @var{exit-forms}  are evaluated sequentially, from left
to  right,  and the value of the last one (or @code{nil}, if the
list @var{exit-forms} is empty) will be returned as the value
of  the  @code{do}  form.  The index variables are then unbound,
their original values are restored, and the evaluation of
the @code{do} form terminates.  
 
Otherwise,  if  the  evaluation of @var{end-test} yields @code{nil},
execution  of  @var{body}  begins; @var{body} is a list of forms,
which are evaluated sequentially, from left to right, and
the results are discarded.  When @var{body} is exhausted, the
evaluation  process  proceeds  to  the  evaluation of the
@var{next} forms.  
 
Any  @var{next} form may be omitted from @var{index-part} when no
assignment  of  the  corresponding  variable  is required
after  iteration; in this case, @var{var} merely serves as an
ordinary  local variable.  Any initiation form @var{init} may
also  be  omitted;  in this case, @code{nil} becomes the initial
value of the corresponding @var{var}.  
 
A @code{do} form, being a macro, is automatically converted into
an  equivalent  combination  of  @code{let}  and @code{loop}.  Thus, to
depart  from  a @code{do} form, the function @code{exit} may be used in
its  @var{body},  @var{exit-part},  or  the  @var{next}  forms of its
@var{index-part}.  It should be borne in mind that, since the
@var{init}  forms  are evaluated outside the @code{loop}, the use of
@code{exit} in an @var{init} form will terminate the evaluation of a
still  "larger"  @code{do}  or  @code{loop}  form  than  the  one under
consideration.  
 
Example: s  Printing  all  the  elements  of  a  list  @code{x}
separated  by  a  space may be performed by the following
program:  
@example
         (do ((l x (cdr l)))
             ((atom l))
             (prin1 (car l))
             (princ " "))
@end example
 
When  each  element  of a vector @code{v} is a number, their sum
may be computed by the following program:  
@example
        (do ((i 0 (1+ i))
              (l (vector-length v))
              (sum 0 (plus sum (vref v i))))
            ((= i l) sum))
@end example
Note  that,  in  this  example,  the body of @code{do} is empty.
This  is,  in  fact, the case in many applications, since
the  index  and  exit  parts of a @code{do} control form can, in
themselves,  be  quite  powerful.   Also  note that, when
(vref v i) is computed, the variable \sexpr{i} still retains its
previous  value, that is, the @var{next} value (1+ i) has not
yet  been assigned to it.  @code{l} does not have a @var{next} part,
and  is merely a temporary variable which facilitates the
computation of @var{end-test}.

@cindex catch
@code{catch} @var{tag . forms} {Special Form}

     @code{catch}  is  a  function  primarily  utilized for non-local exits
     non-local exit.
     (catch @var{tag . forms}) evaluates the elements of
     the  list @var{forms} and returns the value of the last form,
     unless  an  expression  of the form (throw @var{tag .  values})
     with  the same @var{tag} is encountered during the evaluation
     of  @var{forms},  in which case the arguments in @var{values} are
     evaluated,  and @code{catch} immediately returns the last of the
     @var{values}  (or @code{nil} when @var{values} is empty) and performs no
     further evaluation.  
 
     Note:   The argument @var{tag} is evaluated, which is not the
     case  in  some  other Lisp systems.  However, no repeated
     evaluation  is  applied  to  the  elements  of  the  list
     @var{forms},  which  are  evaluated  only  once as the normal
     arguments  of  a  function.   The special action of @code{catch}
     occurs  during  the  evaluation  of its arguments, rather
     than  during  the execution of @code{catch} itself; the function
     @code{catch},  in itself, only returns its last argument (or @code{nil}
     when  there is only one argument @var{tag}) if the evaluation
     of its arguments is completed without calling @code{throw}.  
 
     Example: 
@example
       (catch 'atomic
         (mapcar l
           (function
             (lambda (x)
               (cond ((atom x) (throw 'atomic x))
                     (t (car x)))))))
@end example
 
     This  program  returns  a  list  of  the   @code{car} 's  of the
     elements of the list @code{l}, if the latter are all non-atomic,
     otherwise, the first atomic element of @code{l} is returned.  


@cindex throw
@code{throw} @var{tag . values} {Function}

     As  described  above,  @code{throw}  is used in conjunction with
     @code{catch} for (primarily non-local) exits.  @code{throw} conveys the
     value  of  the  last  argument  in  @var{values} (or @code{nil} when
     @var{values} is empty) back to the closest preceding @code{catch} in
     the execution sequence which possesses the same @var{tag} and
     has  not  yet  been  evoked.   Any  @code{catch} forms (or other
     control  forms  or functions) which may be nested between
     the  @code{throw} form under consideration and the corresponding
     @code{catch} are effectively ignored.  See the above description
     of @code{catch} for further details.  
 
     Note:   As  in the case of @code{catch}, both @var{tag} and forms in
     @var{values} are evaluated, unlike the corresponding function
     @code{throw} in some other Lisp systems.  
 
     Example:   The following program returns @code{a} rather than @code{b}. 
@example
           (catch 'a (catch 'b (throw 'a 'a)) 'b)
@end example

Mapping 
@cindex mapping
 is a type of iteration in which a certain function is
successively  applied  to portions of a list or a vector given
as  an  argument.  There are several options for the manner in
which  the  portions  of the list or the vector are chosen and
the  results  returned  by the application of the function are
presented.  
 
The table shows the relations between the six map functions on
list structures.

@cindex map
@code{map} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive sublists
     of  @var{list},  i.e.,  first  @var{list} itself, then its  @code{cdr} ,
     then   @code{cddr} ,  and so on.   The  value returned is its original
     argument @var{list} (possibly modified by @var{fn}).  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (map '(a b c) (function prin1))
@end example
     This  program prints out
@example
     	(a b c)(b c)(c)
@end example
     and returns (a b c)

 
@cindex mapc
@code{mapc} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive elements
     of  @var{list},  i.e.,  first  the   @code{car}  of @var{list}, then its
      @code{cadr} ,  then   @code{caddr} ,  and so on.   The value returned is its
     original argument @var{list} (possibly modified by @var{fn}).  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (mapc '(a b c) (function prin1))
@end example
     This  program prints out
@example
     	abc
@end example
     and returns (a b c)


@cindex maplist
@code{maplist} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive sublists
     of  @var{list},  i.e.,  first  @var{list} itself, then its  @code{cdr} ,
     then  @code{cddr} , and so on.  The value returned is a newly created
     list of the results of these applications.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (maplist '(a b c) (function prin1))
@end example
     This  program prints out
@example
     	(a b c)(b c)(c)
@end example
     and returns ((a b c) (b c) (c))


@cindex mapcar
@code{mapcar} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive elements
     of  @var{list}, i.e., first  @code{car}  of @var{list}, then its  @code{cadr} ,
     then  @code{caddr} , and so on
	 .  The value returned is a newly created
     list of the results of these applications.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (mapcar '(a b c) (function prin1))
@end example
     This  program prints out
@example
     	abc
@end example
     and returns (a b c) , which
     appears   the   same  as  the  original  arguments,  but,
     actually, has newly been created.  

 
@cindex mapcon
@code{mapcon} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive sublists
     of  @var{list},  i.e.,  first  @var{list} itself, then its  @code{cdr} ,
     then   @code{cddr} ,  and so on.  The value returned is the results of
     these applications concatenated together.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (mapcon '(a b c) (function ncons))
@end example
     This program returns ((a b c) (b c) (c))

 
@cindex mapcan
@code{mapcan} @var{list fn} {Function}

     The  function  @var{fn} is applied to the successive elements
     of  @var{list}, i.e., first  @code{car}  of @var{list}, then its  @code{cadr} ,
     then   @code{caddr} , etc.  The value returned is the results of
     these applications concatenated together.  

     Example:   
@example
           (mapcan '(a b c) (function ncons))
@end example
     This  program  returns (a b c), which appears the same as
     the  original  argument,  but,  actually,  has newly been
     created.  

 
@cindex mapv
@code{mapv} @var{vector fn} {Function}

     @code{mapv}  successively  applies  @var{fn}  to all the elements of
     @var{vector},  in increasing order of indices.  The arguments
     presented  to  the  function @var{fn} are  @code{reference}  objects
     "pointing"  to  the elements of @var{vector}.  See Chapter 9,
     "Vectors",  for  further  information  about  @code{reference} .
     The  value  returned  by  @code{mapv}  is  simply  the  original
     argument  @var{vector} (possibly modified by the execution of
     the function @var{fn}).  
 
     Example:   
@example
        (mapv (vector 5)
          (function (lambda (r)
                      (setref r (read)))))
@end example
     This   will   return   a  vector  of  five  Lisp  objects
     consecutively read in.  

 
@cindex mapvector
@code{mapvector} @var{vector fn} {Function}

     @code{mapvector}  also  applies  @var{fn}  to  all  the  elements of
     @var{vector},  in  increasing  order  of indices. However, in
     this  case,  the  arguments  presented  to  @var{fn}  are the
     elements themselves, rather than  @code{references}  "pointing" to
     them  (see the description of @code{mapv}).  @code{mapvector} returns a
     new  vector the components of which are the corresponding
     results of these applications.

@cindex car
@code{car} @var{x} {Function}

@code{car}  returns  the  @code{car}  of @var{x}. If @var{x} is an atom, an
error is generated.  

 
@cindex cdr
@code{cdr} @var{x} {Function}

@code{cdr}  returns the  @code{cdr}   of  @var{x}.  If @var{x} is an atom, an
error is generated.  

 
@cindex c...r
@code{c...r} @var{x} {Function}

All  the  compositions  of  @code{car}  and @code{cdr}, upto a total of
four,  are  defined  as, so-called, "built-in" functions.
The  names of these functions begin with @code{c}, followed by
a  sequence  of  @code{a}'s  and  @code{d}'s  corresponding  to the
indicated composition of functions, and end with @code{r}.  
 
     Example: 
@example
         (cddar @var{x})
@end example
     is effectively the same as 
@example
         (cdr (cdr (car @var{x}))) 
@end example

 
@cindex cr
@code{cr} @var{x} {Function}

     @code{cr}  returns  @var{x} itself, and is the function in the @code{c...r}
     group  for  which  the total number of @code{a}'s and @code{d}'s is
     zero.   This  function  is  sometimes useful when dealing
     with   mapping  functions.   For  example,
@example
	(mapcar  @var{list} (function  cr)) 
@end example
     may be used to obtain a top-level copy of @var{list}.  

 
@cindex cons
@code{cons} @var{x y} {Function}

     @code{cons}  is  a primitive function which creates a new  @code{cons} 
     cell,  the  @code{car}   and   @code{cdr}   of  which are @var{x} and @var{y},
     respectively.  
 
     Example: s  
@example
           (cons 'a 'b)  =>  (a . b)
           (cons 'a '(b c d))  =>  (a b c d)
@end example

 
@cindex ncons
@code{ncons} @var{x} {Function}

     (ncons @var{x}) is effectively the same as
     (cons @var{x} nil)

 
@cindex xcons
@code{xcons} @var{y x} {Function}

     @code{xcons}  (an  abbreviation of "eXchange @code{cons}") differs from
     @code{cons} only in that the order of the arguments is reversed.
     @code{xcons}  is useful when the  @code{cdr}  part of the result should
     be evaluated before the  @code{car}  part.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (xcons 'a 'b)  =>  (b . a)
@end example

 
@cindex copy
@code{copy} @var{x} {Function}

     @code{copy}  creates  and  returns  a copy of @var{x}.  The atoms
     constituting  the copy are the same as those constituting
     the  original  argument  @var{x}, but all the  @code{cons}  cells of
     the copy are newly created.  
 
     Note:   List  structures  in  which  a non-atomic node is
     indicated  by  more  than  one  pointer  are  not  copied
     faithfully;  such nodes will be duplicated in the "copy".
     Copying a cyclic structure in this manner results in an
     endless computation.  

 
@node ListMani, AlterLst, ConsMani, ListStru
@section List Manipulation
 
The  following  section  explains  some of the basic functions
provided   for   manipulating    @code{lists} . A  @code{list}   is  defined
recursively  as  either  the  symbol  @code{nil}, which represents an
empty  list,  or  a  @code{cons}  whose  @code{cdr}  is a list.  However, it
should  be noted that, although their arguments are denoted by
the  word  @code{list} , the functions described below are applicable
whether or not the final atom is @code{nil}. Most functions treat the 
dotted list as if the last non- @code{nil}  atom being  @code{nil} .
 


@cindex last
@code{last} @var{list} {Function}

     @code{last}  returns  the  last  top-level  @code{cons}  of @var{list}.  If
     @var{list}  is  an  atom,  an error is generated; if the toplevel
     structure  of  @var{list}  is  cyclic, then an endless
     computation occurs.  
 
     Example: 
@example
           (last '(a (b c) d e))  =>  (e)
	   (last '(a b c . d)) => (c . d)

@cindex length
@code{length} @var{list} {Function}

     @code{length}  returns  the  length  of @var{list}.  The length of a
     list is the number of its top-level elements.  
 
     As  in  the  case  of @code{last}, if the top-level structure of
     @var{list} is cyclic, an endless computation occurs.  
 
     Example: s
@example
           (length '(a (b c) d e))  =>  4
           (length nil)  =>  0
		   (length '(a b c . d)) => 3
@end example

 
@cindex first
@code{first} @var{x} {Function}

(first @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(car @var{x})}

 
@cindex second
@code{second} @var{x} {Function}

(second @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(cadr @var{x})}

 
@cindex third
@code{third} @var{x} {Function}

(third @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(caddr @var{x})}

 
@cindex fourth
@code{fourth} @var{x} {Function}

(fourth @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(cadddr @var{x})}

 
@cindex fifth
@code{fifth} @var{x} {Function}

(fifth @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(car (cddddr @var{x}))}

 
@cindex sixth
@code{sixth} @var{x} {Function}

(sixth @var{x}) is equivalent to \sexpr{(cadr (cddddr @var{x}))}

 
@cindex seventh
@code{seventh} @var{x} {Function}

\sexpr{(seventh @var{x})} is equivalent to \sexpr{(caddr (cddddr @var{x}))}

 
@cindex nth
@code{nth} @var{n list} {Function}

@code{nth}  returns the @var{n}th top-level element of @var{list}, where
(car @var{list}) is counted as the zeroth element.  If @var{n} is
negative  or not less than the length of @var{list}, an error
is  generated.  Note that (nth 2 @var{x}) is actually
\sexpr{(third @var{x})} rather than \sexpr{(second @var{x}).  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (nth 2 '(a b c d e))  =>  c
@end example

 
@cindex nthcdr
@code{nthcdr} @var{n list} {Function}

     @code{nthcdr}  applies @code{cdr} to the second argument for @var{n} times,
     and  returns  the result; for @var{n}=0, the result is simply
     @var{list}  itself.   If @var{n} is negative or not less than the
     length of @var{list}, an error is generated.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (nthcdr 2 '(a b c d e))  =>  (c d e)
@end example

 
@cindex list
@code{list} @var{. args} {Function}

     @code{list}  constructs  and  returns  a  list of its arguments,
     ordered in the same manner as the arguments themselves.  
 
     Example: s  
@example
           (list 1 2 (car '(3 5)) (+ 2 2))  =>  (1 2 3 4)
           (list)  =>  nil
@end example

 
@cindex append
@code{append} @var{. lists} {Function}

     The  result  of  @code{append} is essentially a concatenation of
     its arguments, however, avoiding physical alteration, the
     arguments  are  copied (except for the last one; see also
     the  description  of  @code{nconc}  below).   The  tail  of  the
     resulting  list  is physically identical with that of the
     last argument.  
 
     Example: s
@example
           (append '(a b c) '(d e) nil '(f g h))
                   =>  (a b c d e f g h)
           (append)  =>  nil
@end example
 
     Note:   When  several  lists  are to be @code{append}ed and the
     order of the resulting list is not essential, the longest
     argument  should  be placed last since it is not copied;
     this  reduces  both  computing  time  and required memory
     space. 

 
@cindex reverse
@code{reverse} @var{list} {Function}

     @code{reverse}  creates  a  new  list, the top-level elements of
     which  are  the  same  as those of @var{list} but arranged in
     reverse  order.   @code{reverse},  unlike  @code{nreverse} (see below),
     does not modify its argument.  
 
     Example: 
@example
           (reverse '(a (b c) d))  =>  (d (b c) a)
@end example

 
@cindex nconc
@code{nconc} @var{. lists} {Function}

     @code{nconc}  returns  a  list which is the concatenation of the
     arguments.   The  arguments  (except  the  last  one) are
     physically  altered  in  the manner of @code{rplacd} rather than
     copied (see also the description of @code{append} above). 
 
     Example: s
@example
           (setq x '(a b c))
           (setq y '(d e f))
           (nconc x y)  =>  (a b c d e f)
           x  =>  (a b c d e f)
@end example
     Note  that  the value of @code{x} itself has been altered, since
     the   @code{cdr}   of  its  last  @code{cons}  has been replaced by the
     value of @code{y}.  
	 Note: when x is nil,x is not altered.So,you use not side effect
	 but return value.

 
@cindex nreverse
@code{nreverse} @var{list} {Function}

     @code{nreverse}  reverses  its argument @var{list}, which is altered
     in  the  @code{rplacd}  manner throughout the list (see also the
     description of @code{reverse}).  
 
     Example: 
@example
           (setq x '(a b c))
           (nreverse x)  =>  (c b a)
           x  =>  (a)
@end example
     Note  that  the value of @code{x} itself has been altered, since
     the original list has been modified in @code{rplacd} fashion.  


@cindex push
@code{push} @var{item var} {Special Form}

     (push @var{item var}) has the same effect and value as 
@example
           (setq @var{var} (cons @var{item var}))
@end example
     but  is  more  readable.  @var{var} must be a bound variable.
     @code{push}   is   useful,   along  with  @code{pop}  (see  below),  in
     maintaining a list in the manner of a push-down stack.  

 
@cindex pop
@code{pop} @var{var} {Special Form}

     (pop @var{var}) has the same effect and value as 
@example
           (prog1 (car @var{var}) (setq @var{var} (cdr @var{var})))
@end example
     but  is  more  readable.  @var{var} must be a symbol which is
     bound  to  a  non-atomic  value prior to the execution of
     @code{pop}. @code{pop}  is  useful,  along  with @code{push} (see above), in
     maintaining a list in the manner of a push-down stack.  

 
@node AlterLst, Tables, ListMani, ListStru
@section Alteration of List Structure
 
The  functions  @code{rplaca} and @code{rplacd} serve to alter existing list
structure;  that  is,  to  change  the   @code{car}   and   @code{cdr}  of
existing  @code{cons}  cells.  
 
Since  structure  is  physically  altered  rather than copied,
caution  should  be  exercised  when using these functions, as
unexpected  side effects may occur if portions of the affected
list  structures  are  common  to  several  Lisp objects.  The
functions  @code{nconc}  and  @code{nreverse}  also  alter  list  structure,
however,  they  are  not  normally  used  to obtain such side effect side effect,
rather,  the concomitant list-structure modification
is   effected   purely   for   the   sake  of  efficiency  and
corresponding non-destructive functions are also available.  
 


@cindex rplaca
@code{rplaca} @var{x y} {Function}

@code{rplaca}  replaces  the   @code{car}   of  @var{x}  by @var{y} and returns
(modified)  @var{x}.   @var{x} must be a  @code{cons} , while @var{y} may be
any Lisp object.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (setq x '(a b c))
           (rplaca x 'n)  =>  (n b c)
           x  =>  (n b c)
@end example

 
@cindex rplacd
@code{rplacd} @var{x y} {Function}

@code{rplacd}  replaces  the  @code{cdr}   of  @var{x}  by @var{y} and returns
(modified)  @var{x}.   @var{x} must be a  @code{cons} , while @var{y} may be
any Lisp object.  
 
     Example: 
@example
           (setq x '(a b c))
           (rplacd x 'c)  =>  (a . c)
           x  =>  (a . c)
@end example


@cindex subst
@code{subst} @var{x y z} {Function}

(subst @var{x y z}) substitutes @var{x} for all occurrences
of @var{y} in @var{z}  (using @code{eq} for testing equality) and
returns the modified copy of @var{z}. The original @var{z} is not
altered, as @code{subst} recursively copies all the  @code{cons}  cells of
@var{z}, replacing by @var{x} all elements which are @code{eq}
to @var{y}.  
 
Example:   
@example
   (subst 'a 'b '(a b (c b))) =>  (a a (c a))
@end example

Note:   List  structures  in  which  a non-atomic node is
designated  by  more  than  one  pointer  are  not copied
faithfully;  such nodes will be duplicated in the "copy".
Applying  @code{subst}  to  a  cyclic  structure  results  in an
endless computation.  

 
@node Tables, Sorting, AlterLst, ListStru
@section Tables
 
UtiLisp32  provides  several  functions  which  simplify the
maintenance  of  several  varieties of tabular data structures
assembled from  @code{cons}  cells.  
 
The  simplest  of these structures is just an ordinary list of
items, which represents an ordered set.  
 
An  association list is a list the element of which are  @code{cons} 
cells.   The  @code{car}   of each such  @code{cons}  is called a "key" and
the  @code{cdr}  represents an associated datum.  
 
Although these simple data structures are convenient for small
data  bases,  their  form  is  such that search time increases
linearly with the size of the data base, and consequently they
are  inefficient  when handling large amounts of data.  Large-
scale data bases are best maintained using vectors and hashing
functions (see Chapter ~@pxref{Hashing} for details).  



@cindex memq
@code{memq} @var{item list} {Function}

     (memq @var{item list}) returns @code{nil} if @var{item}
     is not identical (with respect to the function @code{eq}) with one of the
     elements  of @var{list}, otherwise, it returns the portion of
     @var{list}  beginning  with  the  first occurrence of @var{item}.
     The  procedure  searches  @var{list}  on  the top-level only.
     Since @code{memq} returns @code{nil} if @var{item} is not found, and a
     non-@code{nil}  object  if  it  is  found,  @code{memq}  may  be  used as a
     predicate.  

     Example:   
@example
           (setq x '(a b c d e))
           (memq 'c x)  =>  (c d e)
           (memq 'foo x)  =>  nil
@end example


@cindex member
@code{member} @var{item list} {Function}

     @code{member}  functions in the same manner as @code{memq}, except that
     @code{equal}, rather than @code{eq}, is used for comparison.  

 
@cindex mem
@code{mem} @var{predicate item list} {Function}

     @code{mem}  functions in the same manner as @code{memq}, except that it
     takes  an additional argument @var{predicate}, which may
     be  any  predicate  taking two arguments.
@example
        (mem (function eq) @var{a b})
@end example
     is  effectively identical with
@example
        (memq @var{a b})
@end example
     and
@example
        (mem (function equal) @var{a b})
@end example
     with
@example
        (member @var{a b})
@end example
 
     Example:   
@example
         (mem (function (lambda (x y) (0= (+ x y))))
              13
              '(1 3 -4 -13 7 -6))
            =>  (-13 7 -6)
@end example

 
@cindex delq
@code{delq} @var{item list (n)} {Function}

     When  the  optional  argument @var{n} is absent, @code{delq} returns
     @var{list}  with all top-level occurrences of @var{item} deleted;
     @code{eq}  is  used  for  comparison.   The  argument  @var{list} is
     actually altered in the @code{rplacd} manner when occurrences of
     @var{item}  are  exercised,  except that any initial segment of
     @var{list}  all the elements of which are @code{eq} to @var{item} is not
     altered  in  this  manner (see Example below).  If @var{n} is
     present,  it  must  be  a  @code{fixnum}  and only the first @var{n}
     top-level  occurrences of @var{item} are deleted.  @var{n} may be
     zero,  in  which  case, @var{list} itself is returned without
     any alteration.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (setq x '(a b a b))
           (delq 'b x)  =>  (a a)
           x  =>  (a a)
@end example
 
     Note:   @code{delq}  should  be  used for value, not for effect.
     Thus, the two pairs of operations 
@example
           (setq y '(a b a b))
           (setq y (delq 'a y))
@end example
     and 
@example
           (setq y '(a b a b))
           (delq 'a y)
@end example
     result  in  different values of @code{y}.  The value returned by
     @code{delq} is (b b) in both cases.  However, @code{y} is given the
     value (b b)} in the former case and \sexpr{(a b b) in the latter.

 
@cindex remq
@code{remq} @var{item list (n)} {Function}

     @code{remq}  yields  the same result as @code{delq}, except that @var{list}
     itself  is not altered; what is returned is a copy of the
     original  argument  @var{list}  with  the first @var{m}
     top-level occurrences of @var{item} removed, where @var{m} is the
     minimum of @var{n} and the number of top-level occurrences of
     @var{item} in @var{list}.  

 
@cindex every
@code{every} @var{list predicate} {Function}

     @code{every}  applies  @var{predicate},  a predicate function of one
     argument,   to   the   top-level   elements   of   @var{list}
     sequentially, from left to right.  If @var{predicate} returns
     non-@code{nil}  for every element, then @code{every} returns @code{t}.  If any
     of  these applications yields @code{nil}, then @code{every} returns @code{nil}
     immediately, and no further applications are executed.  

 
@cindex some
@code{some} @var{list predicate} {Function}

     @code{some}  applies  @var{predicate},  a  predicate function of one
     argument,   to   the   top-level   elements   of   @var{list}
     sequentially, from left to right.  If @var{predicate} returns
     non-@code{nil}  for  some element, then @code{some} immediately returns
     the  portion  of  @var{list} beginning with the element which
     yielded   non-@code{nil},   and   no  further  applications  are
     executed.   If  all the applications yield @code{nil}, then @code{some}
     returns @code{nil}. 

 
@cindex assq
@code{assq} @var{item alist} {Function}

     @code{assq}  searches  for  and returns the first element in the
     association list  @var{alist}  the   @code{car}   of which is @code{eq} to
     @var{item},  if  such an element exists, or otherwise,
     @code{nil}  is returned.  The association list may be updated by
     applying  @code{rplacd}  to the result of @code{assq}, if the latter is
     not @code{nil}.  
 
     Example:   
@example
           (assq 'c '((a b) (c d) (e f))) =>  (c d)
@end example


@cindex assoc
@code{assoc} @var{item alist} {Function}

     @code{assoc}  functions  in the same manner as @code{assq}, except that
     @code{equal} instead of @code{eq} is used for comparison.  

 
@cindex ass
@code{ass} @var{predicate item alist} {Function}

     @code{ass}  functions in the same manner as @code{assq}, except that it
     takes  an  additional  argument  @var{predicate}, a predicate
     taking  two  arguments, which is used for comparison.  In
     the  special  case where @var{predicate} is @code{eq}, this function
     effectively reduces to @code{assq}.  


@node Sorting, Hashing, Tables, ListStru
@section Sorting
 

@cindex sort
@code{sort} @var{table predicate} {Function}

     The  list  @var{table} is arranged in increasing order, using
     the  ordering  relation corresponding to @var{predicate}, and
     the  resulting  ordered  list  is  returned.  @var{predicate}
     should be a function of two arguments, which returns non-@code{nil}
     if  and  only if the first argument is strictly less
     than the second in the sense of total ordering relation. 

     Example: 
@example
       (sort '(3 1 4 5 2) 'greaterp)
             => (5 4 3 2 1)
@end example

 
@node Hashing, , Sorting, ListStru
@section Hashing
 
Some  hashing  scheme  is  desirable  in  order  to reduce the
computing time required for data retrieval in large-scale data
bases.   Time required for searching an item remains constant
using  hashing,  as  long  as  the hash table is large enough,
compared with the number of its entries.  
 
UtiLisp32  provides a standard hashing function for
Lisp  objects  to  facilitate  the maintainance of hashed data
bases.  
 


@cindex hash
@code{hash} @var{x} {Function}

     @code{hash}  computes  hash  value  for @var{x} and returns it as an
     integer  number   @code{fixnum} .   The  result may be positive,
     negative, or zero.  Its properties guaranteed are:  
@enumerate
      
@item
  Objects which are @code{equal} are hashed to the equal value.  
      
@item
 A  @code{fixnum}  is hashed to itself.  
	  
@item
 A  @code{bignum}  is hashed to non negative value.
      
@item
 A string is hashed to non-negative value.  
      
@item
  A  symbol  is hashed to the same value as its print-name.

Symbolic atoms 
@cindex symbolic atom
 such as @code{x} or @code{cons} are
called  @code{symbols}  
@cindex symbol
 in 
UtiLisp32.   A   @code{symbol}   is associated with four Lisp objects; the
 @code{binding}   is  the  value  of  the symbol when it is used as a
variable; the @code{definition} is the functional definition of the
 @code{symbol}   when  it is used as the name of a function or a macro;
the  @code{property list}  is  used to retain various Lisp objects
associated with the  @code{symbol} ; the @code{print name} is used for input
and output operations.  
 
@node TheValue, Definiti, , Symbols
@section The Value
A   @code{symbol}   may  be associated with its @code{value}, which may be a
Lisp  object  of  any  type,  and is returned as the result of
evaluating  the  @code{symbol} .  The  @code{symbol}  may be in @code{unbound}
state,
in  which  case  the   @code{symbol}   has  no  value  at  all; when an
 @code{unbound symbol}   is evaluated, an error is generated.  Newly
created  @code{symbols}  (by @code{intern}, @code{gensym}, etc.) are initially in the
 @code{unbound}   state.   A   @code{symbol}   is called a @code{variable} when the
primary concern is its value.  
 
The  value  of  a  variable  may be changed either by  @code{@code{lambda}-binding} 
or by @code{assignment}; when a  @code{symbol}  is  @code{@code{lambda}-bound} ,
its  previous  value  is  saved  and  will  be restored later,
whereas   @code{assignment}   discards  the previous value.   @code{@code{lambda}-binding} 
is sometimes called simply  @code{binding}  in this manual. 
 
The symbols @code{nil} and @code{t} always must be  bound to themselves; they may
not  be  assigned  nor @code{lambda}-bound (The error of changing the
value of @code{t} or @code{nil} is not detected!). 
 


@cindex set
@code{set} @var{variable new-value} {Function}

      @code{Assignment}    to  @var{variable}  is  effected  by  the
     function  @code{set}.   The  value  of  @var{variable} is changed to
     @var{new-value}  which  may be any Lisp object.  The previous
     value  of  @var{variable}, if any, is discarded.  @code{set} returns
     the newly assigned value @var{new-value}.  


@cindex setq
@code{setq} @var{. args} {Special Form}

     (setq @var{x y}) is effectively the same as
     (set '@var{x y})  
 
     Additional  feature  of  @code{setq} is concurrent assignment of
     variables  without  explicit temporary variables.  A @code{setq}
     form such as 
@example
          (setq @var{var1 form1 var2 form2} @dots{})
@end example
     is used for this purpose.  @var{form1}, @var{form2}, @dots{}  are all
     evaluated first, sequentially, in this order.  Then their
     resulting values are assigned to @var{var1}, @var{var2}, @dots{}  
 
     Example:    Values  of  two  variables  @code{x}  and  @code{y} are
     exchanged by 
@example
          (setq x y y x)
@end example


@cindex boundp
@code{boundp} @var{variable} {Function}

     @code{boundp}  returns  @code{t}  if @var{variable} is bound to some value;
     otherwise, i.e., if it is unbound, @code{nil} is returned.  

 
@cindex make-unbound
@code{make-unbound} @var{variable} {Function}

     @code{make-unbound} makes @var{variable} unbound.  The current value
     of   @var{variable},  if  any,  is  discarded.   @code{make-unbound}
     returns the symbol @var{variable} as its value.  


@node Definiti, PropList, TheValue, Symbols
@section The Definition
 
A  symbol  may be associated with its @code{functional definition},
or  @code{definition} , for short.  When a function is called via its
name,  that is, when the first argument of @code{funcall} or @code{apply} is
a  symbol,  or  a  symbol appears as the  @code{car}  of a form to be
evaluated,  the  @code{definition}  of  that  symbol is called as a
function.   When  a  symbol is not defined as a function nor a
macro,  the  symbol  is  said  to  be  @code{undefined} ; an error is
generated when an undefined symbol is used as a function.  



@cindex defun
@code{defun} @var{name lambda-list . body} {Macro}

     @code{defun} is used for defining functions.  @var{name} should
     be a symbol.  A list 
@example
          (lambda @var{lambda-list . body})
@end example
     will  be  the  new  definition  of  @var{name}.  The previous
     definition  of  @var{name},  if  any,  is  discarded.   @code{defun}
     returns @var{name} as its value.  

 
@cindex macro
@code{macro} @var{name lambda-list . body} {Macro}

     @code{macro}  is used for defining macros.  @var{name} should be
     a symbol.  A list 
@example
          (macro lambda (@var{arg}) @var{. body})
@end example
     will  be  the  new  definition  of  @var{name}.  The previous
     definition  of  @var{name},  if  any,  is  discarded.   @code{macro}
     returns @var{name} as its value.  
 
     Note:    Macros  are  more  elegantly  defined  using
     @code{defmacro}.  See Chapter ~@pxref{Macros} "Macros", for detail.  


@cindex getd
@code{getd} @var{sym} {Function}

     @code{getd}  returns the definition of a symbol @var{sym}.  If @var{sym}
     is undefined, an error is generated.  

 
@cindex putd
@code{putd} @var{sym def} {Function}

     @code{putd} makes the definition of @var{sym} be @var{def}. @var{sym}
     must be  a  symbol  while  @var{def}  may  be any Lisp object.  It
     returns @var{sym} as its value.  

 
@cindex definedp
@code{definedp} @var{sym} {Function}

     @code{definedp} returns @code{t} if @var{sym} is defined as a function or a
     macro;  otherwise,  i.e.,  if  it  is  undefined,  @code{nil} is
     returned.  
 
     Note:   @code{definedp}  returns @code{nil} for special form indicators
     such  as  @code{cond}, since they are not defined as an ordinary
     function  nor  a  macro.   Use the function @code{specialp} (see
     below) to discriminate special form indicators.  

 
@cindex specialp
@code{specialp} @var{sym} {Function}

     @code{specialp}  returns  @code{t} if @var{sym} is a special form indicator
     (such as @code{cond} or @code{prog}); otherwise, it returns @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex make-undefined
@code{make-undefined} @var{sym} {Function}

     @code{make-undefined} makes the symbol @var{sym} undefined.  Current
     definition  of  @var{sym},  if any, is discarded.  It returns
     @var{sym} as its value.  


@node PropList, PrntName, Definiti, Symbols
@section The Property List
 
Every  symbol is associated with its @code{property list}, which is
a list used for associating certain Lisp objects with symbols.
A  @code{property list}  has an even number of elements; each pair of
elements  constitutes  a @code{property}. The first of the pair is
called  the  @code{indicator}  or the  @code{name}  of the  @code{property} , and the
second is a Lisp object called the  @code{value}  of the  @code{property} .  

Example:   
A  @code{property list}  which have the form 
@example
           (Japan Tokyo England London France Paris)
@end example
indicates  that  there  are three  @code{properties}  named @code{Japan},
@code{England} and @code{France}, and their values are @code{Tokyo},
@code{London} and @code{Paris}, respectively.  
 
When a  @code{symbol}  is created, its  @code{property list}  is set initially to @code{nil}. 
 
Note:  @code{Printnames} ,  @code{bindings}  and  @code{functional definitions}  are
often implemented as  @code{properties}  of  @code{symbols}  in various Lisp
systems;   however, they   are   not  implemented  as  usual
 @code{properties}  in UtiLisp32.  



@cindex get
@code{get} @var{sym name} {Function}

@code{get} searches for a  @code{property}  of @var{sym} named @var{name}.  If it
finds  such  a  @code{property} ,  it  returns  the value of that
 @code{property} ; otherwise, it returns @code{nil}.  

Note:   If  the  value  of  a  @code{property}   is  @code{nil},  it  is
impossible  to distinguish whether that  @code{property}  exists or
not, only from the result of @code{get}.  


@cindex putprop
@code{putprop} @var{sym value name} {Function}

If  the  symbol @var{sym} has no  @code{property}  with its name being
@var{name}, then @code{putprop} adds a new  @code{property}  named @var{name}
with  the  value  @var{value};  otherwise,  the  value of the
existing property is updated to @var{value}.  @code{putprop} returns
@var{value} as its resulting value.  

 
@cindex defprop
@code{defprop} @var{sym value name} {Macro}

(defprop @var{x y z}) is effectively the same as
(putprop @var{'x 'y 'z}) 


@cindex defnprop
@code{defnprop} @var{sym value name} {Macro}

(defnprop @var{x y z}) is effectively the same as
(putprop @var{'x} (function @var{y}) @var{'z}) 


@cindex remprop
@code{remprop} @var{sym name} {Function}

@code{remprop} removes the  @code{property}  of @var{sym} with its name being
@var{name}.   If  @var{sym}  has no such  @code{property} , it merely does
nothing.  @code{remprop} returns @code{nil} as its value.  


@cindex plist
@code{plist} @var{sym} {Function}

     @code{plist} returns the  @code{property list}  of @var{sym}.  

 
@cindex setplist
@code{setplist} @var{sym property-list} {Function}

     @code{setplist} sets the   @code{property list}  of @var{sym} to
     @var{property-list}.  It returns @var{property-list} as its value.  


@node PrntName, Creation of Symbols, PropList, Symbols
@section The Print Name
 
Every symbol has an associated string called the @code{print name},
or   @code{pname}   for  short.   This  string is used as the printed
representation of the symbol in input and output operations.  
 
Though   @code{print names}   are  normal character string objects (see
Chapter ~@pxref{Strings} "Strings",  for  more  information  about strings),
modifying  them  (by  @code{sset}, etc.) requires certain care, since
they  are  used  to   @code{hash}   symbols into the Lisp name table,
 @code{obvector}  (see Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut} "Input and Output", for details).  



@cindex pname
@code{pname} @var{sym} @var{(new-name)} {Function}

     @code{pname} returns the  @code{print name}  of the symbol @var{sym}.  
2引数で呼んだ時には, print nameをnew-nameに変更する. 

@node Creation of Symbols, , PrntName, Symbols
@section Creation of Symbols


@cindex symbol
@code{symbol} @var{pname} {Function}

@code{symbol} creates  and returns a new uninterned  @code{symbol}  with its  @code{print name} 
being @var{pname}.  

@cindex symbol-copy @var{symbol} {Function}

@{symbol}とまったく同じシンボルを生成する. 

@cindex gensym
@code{gensym} @var{(prefix) (begin)} {Function}

@code{gensym}  generates  a  new  print name,  and creates a new
"uninterned" symbol with that print name (see Chapter~@pxref{InandOut}
"Input and Output", for "interning").  

The  generated   @code{print name}  is prefixed by a string, which
is initially @code{g} but may be changed by giving @code{gensym} a
string  argument @var{prefix}.  The prefix string is followed
by a 4-digit decimal representation of an integer number.
This  number  is  incremented by one every time @code{gensym} is
called  and only the least significant 4 digits are used.
This number can also be initiated by giving a  @code{fixnum}  to
@code{gensym} as its second argument @var{begin}.  

Example: s  
@example
   (gensym)  =>  g0034
   (gensym "gen")  =>  gen0035
   (gensym "abc" 15)  =>  abc0015
   (gensym)  =>  abc0016
@end example

Note:    @code{Print names}   of  symbols  generated by @code{gensym} are
primarily   for  ease  of  their  inspection  in  printed
representations.   After  ten  thousand @code{gensym} calls, the
 @code{print name}   of  the  generated symbol will be the same as
the first one, but they are not the same symbol,as far as they are not interned.  

 
See  also  Chapter~@pxref{InandOut} "Input and Output", for @code{intern} which may
create a symbol with given  @code{print name} .

@end menu
 
There are three types  of  numbers in UtiLisp32, namely
 @code{fixnums} ,  @code{bignums}  and  @code{flonums} .
 
The  @code{fixnums}  of UtiLisp32 have a signed integer value of 28 bits.
 No overflow  checking  is  made  on  arithmetical  operations  for
 @code{fixnums}  only. All the results are treated modulo $2^{28}$.
 
The  @code{bignums}  are arbitrary long integer. The integer which exceeds
the length of  @code{fixnum}  will be  @code{bignum} . The  @code{bignums}  are made
when the reader reads a big integer and when results of computation exceed 
the limit of  @code{fixnum} . But some functions don't do this conversion.
The  @code{fixnum}  and the  @code{bignum}  are categorized to  @code{integers} 
together.
 
The  @code{flonums}  have a 64-bit floating point value with the
accuracy of about 15 decimal digits in MC68000 microprocessors. In case of Vax, the accuracy is about 
17 decimal digits.
Neither overflow nor underflow are checked on arithmetical operations on 
 @code{flonums} .

 @code{Integers}  are  denoted  using  conventional  decimal notation
(e.g., @code{15}) and  @code{flonums}  using decimal notation with a decimal
point  (e.g.,  @code{15.0});   @code{flonums}  may also have
"exponent part" indicated by the character "@samp{^}" (e.g., @samp{1.5^1}).  
 
Functions   described   in  this  chapter  expect  numbers  of
appropriate  types  for  their  arguments; if an argument of an
illegal type is given, an error is generated.  
 
Functions  on  numbers are grouped into three categories by
the  type  of  the numbers they accept:  Functions the name of
which  includes  alphabetic  characters  (e.g., @code{plus})  are
applied to all of the types of the numbers.
Conversions between  @code{fixnum}  and  @code{bignum}  are automatically made in
these functions.
Functions consisting only of non-alphabetic
characters are special purpose functions.  If their
names  end  with  the  character  "@code{$}" (e.g., @code{+$}), they are for
 @code{flonums}   only;  otherwise  (e.g., @code{+}),  for   @code{fixnums}  only.
Notice that no overflow check or conversion to  @code{bignum}  are made for
 @code{fixnum}  functions.
These  rules  apply  to  all  the  functions described in this
chapter except explicitly stated otherwise.  
 
Special purpose  arithmetic  functions  are  computed more
efficiently  than  general purpose  ones,  especially when the
functions using them are compiled.

texts.  @code{Print names}  of  @code{symbols}  are  also represented using
 @code{strings} .  

Characters of a  @code{string}  may be independently referenced and
updated  using  @code{sref} and  @code{sset},  respectively.  The subscript 
@cindex subscript

origin  for  {sl strings} is zero.  If a subscript value specified
is not appropriate, i.e., if it is negative or greater than or
equal  to  the length of the corresponding {sl string}, an error is
generated.  

 @code{Characters}  
@cindex character
 are   @code{fixnums}   which resides between 0 and 255,
i.e.,  representable  in  one byte (8 bits).  They are usually
treated   as  ASCII  character  codes  in  input  and  output
operations.  

 @code{Strings}  may also  be  seen  as  @code{vectors}  of small non negative
integer   @code{fixnums}   ranging 0 through 255.  This kind of usage
may save a considerable memory space, compared with the use of
normal vectors which requires 4 bytes for each component.

 @code{Characters}  are a  @code{fixnum}   which resides between 0 and 255.
They   are  treated  as  ASCII  codes  in  input  and  output
operations.  



@cindex character
@code{character} @var{x} {Function}

Some  of the functions manipulating  @code{strings}  require their
arguments to be  a   @code{character} .   Though  most  of  the
functions   introduced   in  this  chapter  automatically
coerce   @code{strings}   or   @code{symbols}   to   @code{characters} ,  there are
certain cases in which explicit conversion is required.  
 
@code{character}  coerces @var{x} to a single  @code{character} , represented
as  a   @code{fixnum} .  If @var{x} is a  @code{character} , i.e.  a  @code{fixnum} 
which  resides between 0 and 255, @var{x} itself is returned.
If  @var{x}  is  a  non-null   @code{string} ,  its first character is
returned.  If @var{x} is a {sl symbol}, the first character of its
 @code{print name}  is   returned.    Otherwise,   an  error  is generated.  


@node StrgMani, ManiChar, Characte, Strings
@section String Manipulation

Note that the subscript 
@cindex subscript
 origin for strings is zero.  



@cindex string
@code{string} @var{x} {Function}

Functions  manipulating  @code{strings}  require  @code{string}  arguments.
Though  most  of the functions introduced in this chapter
automatically  coerce   @code{symbols}   to   @code{strings} ,  there  are
certain cases in which explicit conversion is required.  
 
@code{string}  coerces  @var{x}  into a  @code{string} .
If @var{x} is a  @code{string} , @var{x} itself is returned.
If @var{x} is a  @code{symbol} , its  @code{print name}  is
returned.   If @var{x} is a  @code{character} , a one-character  @code{string} 
containing  @var{x}  is  returned.   Otherwise,  an  error is generated.  


@cindex make-string
@code{make-string} @var{length (char)} {Function}

@code{make-string} allocates  and  returns  a new  @code{string}  of the
length  given  by  @var{length}.   If  the  optional argument
@var{char},  which  must be a  @code{character} , is given, all the
characters  of  the allocated  @code{string}  will be initiated to
@var{char};  otherwise,  to the  @code{fixnum}  0 (not the character
code for "@code{0}").  


@cindex string-length
@code{string-length} @var{string} {Function}

@code{string-length}   returns   the  number  of  characters  in
@var{string},  which  is  one more than the largest subscript
value for @var{string}.

 
@cindex string-equal
@code{string-equal} @var{string1 string2} {Function}

@code{string-equal}  compares  two   @code{strings}  and returns @code{t} if two
 @code{strings}   have  the  same length and all the corresponding
characters are the same; otherwise, it returns @code{nil}.  

Although comparison  of  equality  of  two   @code{strings}   is  also
effected  by  the  function @code{equal}, @code{string-equal} is
more specific and, therefore, more efficient.  

 
@cindex string-lessp
@code{string-lessp} @var{string1 string2} {Function}

@code{string-lessp} compares two  @code{strings}  in dictionary order.
The  result  is  @code{t} if @var{string1} is the lesser, and @code{nil} if
they are equal or @var{string2} is the lesser.  

Example: s  
@example
   (string-lessp "abc" "abd")  =>  t
   (string-lessp "abc" "ab")  =>  nil
@end example

 
@cindex substring
@code{substring} @var{string (start) (end)} {Function}

@code{substring}  extracts  a substring of @var{string}, starting at
the character  indexed  by  @var{start}  up  to  but  not
including  the  character  indexed by @var{end}.  Thus, the
length  of  the   @code{string}   returned  will  be  @var{end}  minus
@var{start}.   The  default  value for @var{end} is the length of
@var{string}, and that of @var{start} is 0.  
 
Example: s
@example
   (substring "abcde" 1 3)  =>  "bc"
   (substring "abcde" 1)  =>  "bcde"
   (substring "abcde")  =>  "abcde"
@end example
 
Note:   Even  if  both  @var{start}  and  @var{end}  are omitted,
@code{substring} makes a new copy of @var{string} and returns that copy.  


@cindex string-append
@code{string-append} @var{ . strings} {Function}

Any  number of  @code{strings}  are copied and concatenated into a
single   @code{string} .   If  no  arguments are given, @code{string-append}
returns a null string \sexpr{""}.


@cindex string-reverse
@code{string-reverse} @var{string} {Function}

@code{string-reverse} returns  a  copy of @var{string} with the order of 
characters reversed.   
The original  @code{string}  is not physically altered (see also the description of
@code{string-nreverse} below).

 
@cindex string-nreverse
@code{string-nreverse} @var{string} {Function}

@code{string-nreverse} returns  @var{string}  with the order of characters
reversed.  The  reversing is made on the argument @var{string} directly,
physically  altering  the order of characters in @var{string}
(see also the description of @code{string-reverse} above).  


@cindex string-search-char
@code{string-search-char} @var{char string (from)} {Function}

@code{string-search-char}  searches  for @var{char} through @var{string}
starting  at  the  index @var{from}.  It returns the index of
the  first appearance of @var{char}, or @code{nil} if none is found.
@var{char} may be a character or a list of characters, in the
latter case, the subscript of the first occurrence of one of  the listed
characters is returned.  The default value for @var{from} is zero.  

Example:   
@example
   (string-search-char "b" "abcde")  =>  1
@end example


@cindex string-search-not-char
@code{string-search-not-char} @var{char string (from)} {Function}

@code{string-search-not-char}  is the same as @code{string-search-char}
except  that  it searches for the occurrence of character
which is  @code{not}  @var{char}, or, when @var{char} is a list,  @code{not}  a
member of @var{char}.  
 
Example:   
@example
   (string-search-not-char "0" "007") =>  2
@end example


@cindex string-search
@code{string-search} @var{key string (from)} {Function}

@code{string-search} searches for the  @code{string}  @var{key} in the  @code{string} 
@var{string}.   The  search  begins  at subscript @var{from}, the
default  value  of  which is zero.  The value returned is
the  subscript  of  the  first  character  of  the  first
instance of @var{key}, or @code{nil} if none is found.  

Example: 
@example
   (string-search "word" "Where is the word?") => 13
@end example


@cindex translate
@code{translate} @var{string table} {Function}

@code{translate}  converts  characters in @var{string} using @var{table}
as the conversion table. 
@cindex conversion table
 @var{table} must be a string of 256
characters.   Its  subscript-{sl n}  character substitutes the
character  whose  code  is  {sl n}.   The argument @var{string} is
physically  altered.   @code{translate}  returns  the (modified)
@var{string}.  


@cindex lower-case
@code{lower-case} {Variable}

@cindex upper-case
@code{upper-case} {Variable}

Values   of   @code{lower-case}   and  @code{upper-case}  are  standard
conversion tables for converting upper-case characters to
lower-case  ones  and  the  reverse, respectively.  These
tables  are  also used by the Lisp reader and the printer
(see Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut} "Input and Output", for details).  

 
@cindex string-amend
@code{string-amend} @var{string1 string2 (from)} {Function}

@code{string-amend} moves characters in @var{string2} into @var{string1}
physically  altering  characters  in  @var{string1}.  All the
characters  in  @var{string2}  are  moved  to  the portion of
@var{string1}  beginning  with  the specified subscript value
@var{from}.  The default value of @var{from} is 0.  

 
@cindex string-amend-and
@code{string-amend-and} @var{string1 string2 (from)} {Function}

@cindex string-amend-or
@code{string-amend-or} @var{string1 string2 (from)} {Function}

@cindex string-amend-xor
@code{string-amend-xor} @var{string1 string2 (from)} {Function}

@code{string-amend-and}, @code{-or} and @code{-xor} are the same as
@code{string-amend} except that characters in @var{string2} are not simply
moved  into  @var{string1},  rather,  logical  "and", "or" or
"xor" of  characters  in  @var{string2}  and  corresponding
characters  in  @var{string1}  are  moved  to  a  portion  of
@var{string1}  beginning  with  the specified subscript value
@var{from}.  The default value of @var{from} is 0.  


@cindex string-trim
@code{string-trim} @var{string (char)} {Function}

@code{string-trim} trims consecutive @var{char}s from both left and right ends
of @var{string} and returns it. The default value of @var{char} is a blank 
space.


@cindex string-left-trim
@code{string-left-trim} @var{string (char)} {Function}

@code{string-trim} trims consecutive @var{char}s from left end
of @var{string} and returns it. The default value of @var{char} is a blank 
space.


@cindex string-right-trim
@code{string-right-trim} @var{string (char)} {Function}

@code{string-trim} trims consecutive @var{char}s from right end
of @var{string} and returns it. The default value of @var{char} is a blank 
space.


@cindex string-match
@code{string-match} @var{pattern string} {Function}

@code{string-match} matches @var{string} against @var{pattern}
and returns @code{t} or @code{nil} according to the result.
 @code{pattern}  is a (limited) regular-expression,
with special characters " @code{?} " and " @code{*} ".
" @code{?} " matches any single character, and " @code{*} " matches
any sequence of characters (possibly empty).
There is no way to escape these special characters.

Example: s  
@example
   (string-match "?b?" "abc")  =>  t
   (string-match "*b*" "b")  =>  t
@end example

@section Manipulation of Characters in Strings

Characters  of  strings  are  independently manipulated by
following  functions.   Note  that  the  subscript  origin  of
strings is zero.  



@cindex getchar
@code{getchar} @var{string index} {Function}

     @code{getchar} returns the @var{index}-th character of @var{string} as an
     interned one-character symbol.  

     Example:   
@example
           (getchar "abc" 2)  =>  c
@end example


@cindex sref
@code{sref} @var{string index} {Function}

     @code{sref}  returns  the  @var{index}-th  character of @var{string} as a
     character, i.e., a  @code{fixnum} .  


@cindex sset
@code{sset} @var{string index character} {Function}

     @code{sset}   sets   the  @var{index}-th  character  of  @var{string}  to
     @var{character}, and returns @var{character}.  


@node ConvStNm, BitStrng, ManiChar, Strings
@section Converting Strings and Numbers

Consecutive  characters  of  a  string  may be considered as a
binary   representation   of  an  integer  number.   Following
functions are for conversions between such character sequences
and  @code{fixnums} .  



@cindex cutout
@code{cutout} @var{string pos length} {Function}

@code{cutout}  converts  a  character  sequence beginning at the
@var{pos}-th character of @var{string} with length @var{length} into a
 @code{fixnum} .  @var{length} should be positive. Upper bytes of the
result will be padded with zero.


@cindex spread
@code{spread} @var{value length} {Function}

@code{spread} converts a @code{fixnum} @var{value} into a string which
contains the binary representation of @var{value}.  The resulting string
has the length @var{length}, which should be positive.  If @var{value}
cannot be represented in @var{length} bytes, only lower bytes are
converted and overflowed upper bytes are ignored.


@node BitStrng, , ConvStNm, Strings
@section Bit String Manipulation
 
A  string  may also be regarded as a sequence of binary digits
(bits).   Thus,  an array of logical values may be represented
by  a  string,  in  which  case,  one character holds eight
distinct  logical  values.   Using  this  representation,  the
memory  space  required  for  a  large-scale bit table will be
eight  times  smaller  than when each character of a string is
used  to represent one logical value, or thirty-two times than
when  each  vector  element  is  used.   To  facilitate such a
representation of bit tables 
@cindex bit table
,
following functions are provided
by  UtiLisp32.   Compact  representation of bit tables using
following   functions  may  save  considerable  memory  space,
however,  computing  speed will be somewhat slowed down.  Note
that functions such as @code{string-amend-and}, @code{-or} and @code{-xor} may also
be useful for logical operation on bit tables.  



@cindex bref
@code{bref} @var{string index} {Function}

@code{bref} returns @code{t} if @var{index}-th bit of @var{string} is set;
otherwise,  it returns @code{nil}.  @var{index} should be non negative
and smaller than eight times the length of @var{string}.  

Note: Bits are indexed from left to right, the most significant bit of the
0th character of  @code{string}  being 0.

 
@cindex bset
@code{bset} @var{string index value} {Function}

If @var{value} is non @code{nil}, the @var{index}-th bit of @var{string}
is set;  otherwise,  it  is  reset.   @var{index}  should  be non
negative  and  smaller  than  eight  times  the length of
@var{string}.  @code{bset} returns @var{value} as its value.

A  @code{vector} 
@cindex vector
 is a Lisp object that consists of a number (possibly zero)
of elements, each of
which  is  a  Lisp  object again.  The individual elements are
selected  by  numerical subscripts 
@cindex subscript
 origined zero.  
An error is
generated  if an subscript value specified is not appropriate,
i.e., if it is negative or not less than the number
of the elements.  
 
As  elements  of a  @code{vector}  are accessed in constant time, it
is  advantageous  compared  with  list structure consisting of
binary   @code{cons}   cells  when  a  large  amount of data is to be
manipulated.   Disadvantage  of  using   @code{vectors} , compared with
 @code{lists} , is that the size should be known before used.  
 
 @code{Vectors}  are arbitrarily allocated and discarded like  @code{cons} 
cells; they are independent objects on their own right, rather
than  being  attributes  of  symbols  as  in  some  other Lisp
systems.   However, it is usually convenient to @code{lambda}-bind or
assign a  @code{vector}  to a  @code{symbol} , to use the  @code{symbol}  as its name,
since  @code{vectors}  are not directly  identified  by  the Lisp reader.  
 
Multi-dimensional  arrays  are  represented  by  @code{vectors}  of
 @code{vectors} ;  @code{vectors}  the elements of which are  @code{vectors}  again.

@cindex vector
@code{vector} @var{size (filler)} {Function}

@code{vector} allocates and returns a  @code{vector}  with its size being
@var{size};  its  subscript  ranges from 0 to @var{size} - 1.
If  the  optional  argument @var{filler}
@cindex filler
 is not given, all
the  elements  of  the  allocated  @code{vector}  are initiated to
@code{nil}. Otherwise, if @var{filler} is given, the allocated
vector  will  be initiated using @var{filler} in the same way
as the function @code{fill-vector} (see the description of
@code{fill-vector} below).  

 
@cindex vector-length
@code{vector-length} @var{vector} {Function}

@code{vector-length} returns the number of elements of @var{vector}.

 
@cindex vref
@code{vref} @var{vector subscript} {Function}

@code{vref} returns the @var{subscript}-th element of @var{vector}.  

 
@cindex vset
@code{vset} @var{vector subscript value} {Function}

@var{vset}  sets @var{value} into  the  @var{subscript}-th  element of
@var{vector}.  @code{vset} returns @var{value} as its value.  

 
@cindex fill-vector
@code{fill-vector} @var{vector filler} {Function}

@code{fill-vector}  fills  @var{vector}  with  specified  data  and
returns (modified) @var{vector}.  
 
When  @var{filler}  is  an   @code{atom}  and  not  a  @code{vector} , all the
elements of @var{vector} become @var{filler}.  
 
When  @var{filler} is a  @code{list}  with  one  or more elements,
@var{vector}  is  filled with the elements of that  @code{list} .  The
subscript  0 element of @var{vector} is assigned the  @code{car}  of
the  @code{list} , subscript 1, the {sl cadr}, and so on.  If the list
is shorter than @var{vector}, remaining elements of @var{vector}
are not affected. If the list is longer, remaining
elements of the list are merely ignored.  
 
When @var{filler} is a  @code{vector} , @var{vector}  is  filled with
corresponding  elements  of  the  filler  @code{vector} .  If the
filler   @code{vector}  is shorter, remaining elements of @var{vector}
are  not  affected.   If  the  filler  @code{vector}   is longer,
remaining  elements  of  the  filler  @code{vector}   are  merely
ignored.  

Example: s   When the value of @code{v} is a  @code{vector}  with, for
example, 10 elements, 
@example
  (fill-vector v nil)
@end example
fills the vector with @code{nil}'s.  
@example
  (fill-vector v '(0 1 2 3 4))
@end example
sets  first 5 elements of the  @code{vector}  with @code{0}, @code{1}, @code{2}, @code{3}, and
@code{4},  respectively.  Remaining 5 elements are not affected.
If the value of @code{w} is another  @code{vector}  with the same size, 
@example
  (fill-vector v w)
@end example
copies the contents of @code{w} into @code{v}.

@section References

It is often required to pass a  @code{vector}  and its subscript as a
pair to functions. It would be more convenient if the pair
could  be  treated  just  as  a  variable.  UtiLisp32 provides
 @code{reference}  objects for this purpose.  

A   @code{reference} 
@cindex reference
  is  a  pointer to an element of a  @code{vector} .  The
pointed  element  is  accessed  by @code{deref} and updated by
@code{setref}. @code{deref} and  @code{setref} are also applied to variables,
i.e., symbols.  It is recommended that @code{deref} and @code{setref} should
be   used   in  functions  which  utilize   @code{call-by-reference} 
@cindex call-by-reference

parameter, instead of @code{eval} and @code{set}.  



@cindex reference
@code{reference} @var{vector subscript} {Function}

@code{reference} makes and returns a  @code{reference}  pointing to the
@var{subscript}-th element of @var{vector}.  


@cindex deref
@code{deref} @var{reference} {Function}

@code{deref}  returns  the  value  of  @var{reference};  if  it is a
symbol,  the value of the symbol; if it is a  @code{reference} ,
the element of a  @code{vector}  it is pointing.  
 

@cindex setref
@code{setref} @var{reference value} {Function}

@code{setref} sets @var{value}  to @var{reference}; if it is a symbol,
its  value  is  set;  if  it  is a reference pointer, the
pointed  element  of  a   @code{vector}   is  set.  @code{setref} returns
@var{value} as its value.  


@cindex referred-vector
@code{referred-vector} @var{reference} {Function}

@code{referred-vector} returns the  @code{vector}  an element of which is
pointed by @var{reference}.  

Note:    Computation   of  this  function  requires  time
proportional  to  the subscript of the element pointed by
@var{reference}.  


@cindex referred-index
@code{referred-index} @var{reference} {Function}

@code{referred-index}  returns  the  subscript of the  @code{vector} 
element pointed by @var{reference}.  

Note:    Computation   of  this  function  requires  time
proportional  to  the subscript of the element pointed by
@var{reference}.

@section Evaluation of Macros
 
When a  @code{cons}  cell with its  @code{car}  being a  @code{symbol}  is evaluated,
the  evaluator inspects the definition of that  @code{symbol} .  If the
definition  is  a   @code{cons}   cell,  and  its  @code{car}  is the  @code{symbol} 
@code{macro}, then that definition is called a  @code{macro} 

@cindex macro
.  The  @code{cdr}  of
the  definition is treated as a function that has one argument.  The
evaluator  applies  that function to the  @code{cdr}  of the original
form.   The  result  of this application is evaluated again by
the evaluator, and the value returned by this re-evaluation is
finally  returned  as  the  result  of  the  evaluation of the
original form.  
 



Example:   
Suppose the definition of @code{ncons} is 
@example
  (macro lambda (x) (list 'cons (car x) nil)) 
@end example
This is a macro; it is a  @code{cons}  the  @code{car}  of which is the
 @code{symbol}  @code{macro}. The evaluation process of a form (ncons 'foo)
is as follows:  
 
The evaluator recognizes that the form to be evaluated is
a   @code{cons}   cell  the   @code{car}   of  which is a  @code{symbol} , i.e.,
@code{ncons}; the definition of the  @code{symbol}  @code{ncons} is examined and
the   @code{car}   of  the  definition is found to be the  @code{symbol} 
@code{macro}.   Then  the  evaluator  takes  the   @code{cdr}   of  the
definition,  which is a @code{lambda}-expression, and applies it
to the  @code{cdr}  of the original form, i.e., the list ('foo).
@code{x}  is  bound  to ('foo) and the result of the application
will be (cons 'foo nil).  

The  evaluator  then  evaluates this new form in place of
the  original one. (cons 'foo nil)} is evaluated to \sexpr{(foo)
and so the result of (ncons 'foo)} is, finally, \sexpr{(foo).  

Macros  may  be expanded recursively; expanded form of a macro
form  can  be  another macro form, in which case, the expanded
form is expanded again, until it becomes a non-macro form.  

Macros  are used for a variety of purposes.  For example,
 @code{custom-made}   control structures are easily implemented with
macros.  




Example:   
@code{while-do} construct such as 
@example
   (while-do @var{condition . body})
@end example
is defined as a macro using @code{macro} special form as 
@example
   (macro while-do (x)
      (nconc (list 'loop
                   (list 'and (car x) '(exit)))
             (cdr x)))
@end example
which expands the original form into 
@example
   (loop (and @var{condition} (exit)) . @var{body})
@end example

Using  macros  may  result  in  a  considerable time and space
overhead   while   the  program  is  executed  interpretively.
However,  once compiled, programs using macros are executed
as  efficiently  as  those  without macros, since the compiler
expands macro  calls  prior  to the compilation.  Thus, using
macros is considered   to   pay  no  penalty  on  run-time
performance. Efficient execution may only be realized through
compilation anyway.  
 
As  macros are expanded in compilation time, macros should not
refer  to  global variables.  The expansion should be the same
in  any  context (on the assumption that, of course, @code{car} still
means @code{car}, @code{cdr} means @code{cdr}, etc).  
 
Macros cannot be applied to arguments in the same way as usual
functions. Macros takes  arguments  which are not evaluated
yet,  while  application  is  calling  a function with already
evaluated  arguments.   Thus,  calling  @code{funcall} or @code{apply} with
macros as the first argument will generate an error.  
 


@cindex macro-expand
@code{macro-expand} @var{. form} {Macro}

@code{macro-expand} only expands a macro in @var{form} and returns it without 
second evaluation.




Example: 
@example
  (macro-expand incr x 3) => (setq x (plus x 3))
@end example


@node Defmacro, Backquot, EvMacros, Macros
@section Defmacro Facility
 
Complicated  macros  must have access to structural details of
their  argument lists.  Such an access requires densely nested
@code{car}  and  @code{cdr}  functions,  which  may  not  only  increase the
difficulty  of programming but also damages the readability of
the  resulting  program. @code{defmacro} facility is provided to
facilitate  access  to portions of the argument list by giving
names to portions of the argument list.  
 


@cindex defmacro
@code{defmacro} @var{name arg-pattern . body} {Macro}

A @code{defmacro} form of the syntax 
@example
  (defmacro @var{name arg-pattern . body})
@end example
is expanded into 
@example
  (macro @var{name} (@@) . @var{expanded-body})
@end example
 
where @var{arg-pattern}  may  be  an arbitrarily complicated
tree  structure of  @code{symbols} , which serves as a template of
the argument list.  Its  @code{car}  represents the  @code{car}  of the
argument   list,  its   @code{cdr} ,  the   @code{cdr}   of  the  list.
@var{expanded-body}  is almost the same as @var{body} except that
all  the  accesses  to  the   @code{symbols}  in @var{arg-pattern} are
converted  to  accesses  to corresponding portions of the
argument list.  
 
Example:    The @code{while-do} in the former example may be more
elegantly defined using @code{defmacro} as follows:  
@example
   (defmacro while-do (@var{condition . body})
      (nconc (list 'loop
                 (list 'and @var{condition} '(exit)))
             @var{body}))
@end example

 
@node Backquot, , Defmacro, Macros
@section Backquote Facility
 
It  is  still  not  easy to define a macro even with @code{defmacro}.
The  difficulty lies in the fact that two different forms must
be  considered  at  a  time:   The expanded form which will be
finally evaluated is one; the form which produces that form is
the  other, and this form is what the programmer have to write
down.   The  backquote  facility is provided to facilitate the
construction of the latter.  
 
The backquote
@cindex backquote
 character ( @code{`} ) is defined as a read 
macro (see
Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut}, "Input and Output" for detail),
which acts similarly to normal single
quote  (')  that  makes  a @var{quote}d  form  of  the S-expression
following  it.  However, when a form included in the following
S-expression  is  preceded  by  a  comma ( @code{,} ), that form is not
@code{quote}d while all the other portions are effectively @code{quote}d.  
 
Example: s  
`@code{x} is read in as (quote x) which is the same as '@code{x}.  

\sexpr{`(a ,b c)} is read in as (list 'a b 'c). As @code{b} is not
quoted, it is evaluated when the whole form is evaluated.

@code{while-do} macro may be still more elegantly defined as 
@example
   (defmacro while-do (@var{condition . body})
       `(loop (and ,@var{condition} (exit))
              . ,@var{body}))
@end example

Backquotes  may  be nested.  When backquotes are nested twice,
double  comma  will  make  a form to be evaluated in the first
evaluation  of  the  whole  form;  a form preceded by a single
comma will be evaluated in its second evaluation.

@section Streams
 
 @code{Streams}  
@cindex stream
  are  Lisp  objects  through  which 
I/O operations are
performed.  Streams may be connected to an external file or to
the  user terminal.  File streams are created by the function
@code{stream}.   They  should  be  opened  by the functions @code{inopen} or
@code{outopen} before being used.  
 
Any  number of streams may be connected to a single external
file.   It  is  also  possible  to  open  two  or more streams
connected  to  one  file  in  output  mode.   However,  it  is
difficult  to  predict the result of output operations in such
cases, since the files are modified through file buffers.  

 

@cindex stream
@code{stream} @var{filename} {Function}

@code{stream}  makes a stream which is connected to the external
file  defined  by  @var{filename}.
Unixのすでにopenされているファイルディスクリプタをストリームにする時は
@var{filename}としてファイルディスクリプタを@code{fixnum}で渡す. 

@cindex string-stream
@code{string-stream} @var{string} {Function}

 文字列をストリームとして扱う. 
 
@cindex inopen
@code{inopen} @var{stream} {Function}

@code{inopen}  opens  @var{stream} as an input stream.  When opening
is  unsuccessful,  an  error  is generated; otherwise, it
returns  @var{stream}.

 
@cindex outopen
@code{outopen} @var{stream} {Function}

@code{outopen}  opens @var{stream} as an output file. 
When opening is unsuccessful, an error is
generated; otherwise, @code{outopen} returns @var{stream}.  

 
@cindex appendopen
@code{appendopen} @var{stream} {Function}

@code{appendopen} opens @var{stream} as an open file and makes it append
mode. When opening is unsuccessful, an error is generated; otherwise,
@code{appendopen} returns @var{stream}.


@cindex close
@code{close} @var{stream} {Function}

@code{close}  closes 
@cindex close
  the  file  associated with @var{stream}.  When
closing   is   unsuccessful,   an   error  is  generated;
otherwise, it returns @var{stream}.  

 
@cindex openfiles
@code{openfiles} {Variable}

The value of @code{openfiles} is a  @code{list}  of  @code{streams}  which are
currently  open.   The  most recently opened  @code{stream}  comes
first  in the  @code{list} .  The  @code{list}  is automatically maintained
by @code{inopen}, @code{outopen}, @code{appendopen}
and @code{close}; the user may not update
the value of @code{openfiles} explicitly.  

Example:   All the files currently open are closed by 
@example
   (mapc openfiles (function close))
@end example

 
@cindex stream-mode
@code{stream-mode} @var{stream} {Function}

@code{stream-mode} returns the current state of @var{stream}; if it
is  open  as an input file, it returns the symbol @code{inopen};
if  it  is  open as an output file, it returns the symbol
@code{outopen}; if it is not open, it returns @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex linelength
@code{linelength} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{linelength}  returns  the  maximum  line  length
allowed,  for  output  streams.   The  default  value for
@var{stream} is the value of @code{standard-output}.  

 
@cindex cursor
@code{cursor} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{cursor} returns current column position of @var{stream} for output streams, where
column zero being the first column.  The default value of
@var{stream} is the value of @code{standard-output}.  

 
@cindex colleft
@code{colleft} @var{(stream)} {Function}

When  @var{stream} is an  output  streams,  it returns how many more characters
can be printed on the current line.  The default value of
@var{stream} is the value of @code{standard-output}.  
 
Note: (@code{cursor}) + (@code{colleft}) is always equal to (@code{linelength}) for outputstreams.  

@cindex charleft
@code{charleft} @var{(stream)} {Function}

 一行の長さが可変長の場合のcolleft.

@cindex string-stream-index
@code{string-stream-index} @var{(string-stream)} {Function}

@cindex string-stream-limit
@code{string-stream-limit} @var{(string-stream)} {Function}

文字列ストリームの何バイト目まで読み書きすることができるかをfixnumで返す. 

 
@cindex standard-input
@code{standard-input} {Variable}

@cindex standard-output
@code{standard-output} {Variable}

Values  of  these  variables  are  streams  for which I/O
operations   are  normally  performed;  values  of  these
variables  are  used  as  the  default  values  of stream
arguments in various I/O functions.  Reading and printing
are elegantly directed to a desired stream by @code{lambda}-binding
these variables to the stream.  Using this style,
these  variables  will recover their old values when they
are unbound.  
The  initial values of @code{standard-input} and @code{standard-output} are the
same    as   those   of   @code{terminal-input}  and   @code{terminal-output},
respectively,  which  are  the streams connected with the
user terminal (see below).  

Example:   
@example
   (let ((standard-input @var{some-stream})) (read))
@end example
is effectively the same as  
@example
   (read @var{some-stream})
@end example

 
@cindex terminal-input
@code{terminal-input} {Variable}

@cindex terminal-output
@code{terminal-output} {Variable}

Values  of  these  variables  are  the  streams which are
connected to the user terminal.  

Example:   While the standard output stream is directed to
some  file  stream,  messages  to  the  terminal  can  be
explicitly  directed  to the terminal as in the following
example 
@example
   (let ((standard-output @var{some-stream}))
      (cond ((null l)
            (print "l is null" terminal-output))
            (t (mapc l 'print))))
@end example

 
@cindex prompt
@code{prompt} {Variable}

Value  of @code{prompt} is a string which is used for prompting 
@cindex prompt

input from the terminal.  Initial value of @code{prompt} is  @code{"> "} .
It  is  recommended  that  subsystems  of the Lisp system
should bind @code{prompt} to certain string which identifies the
subsystem  to notify the terminal user what the prompting
system is, or, what kind of input is expected. 
 
Example:   
@example
   (setq name
         (let ((prompt "Who are you?  "))
              (read)))
@end example

Lisp  objects are not directly handled since they are stored
inside  the  machine  memory.   In order to examine these Lisp
objects,  UtiLisp32 provides a representation of its objects
in  the  form  of  printed  text;  this  is called the printed
representation 
@cindex printed representation
.  
 
Functions  such  as @code{print}, @code{prin1}, and @code{princ} take a Lisp object
as  their  argument,  and  send  the characters of its printed
representation  to  a stream; these functions are known as the
printer 
@cindex printer
.  
 
The  function @code{read} takes characters from a stream, interprets
them  as a printed representation of a Lisp object, constructs
a corresponding object, and returns it; this function is known
as the reader 
@cindex reader
.  
 
This  section describes printed representation of various Lisp
objects.  
 
@node Printer, Reader, , PrtRepre
@subsection The Printer
 
Printing is done either with or without @code{slashification}.  The
 @code{non slashified}   representation  looks simple and readable to
human  eyes, but they may not be properly read in again by the
machine.  The  @code{slashified}  version is faithfully converted
back  into  Lisp  objects  by  @code{read},  except for some peculiar
objects, namely,  @code{streams} ,  @code{vectors} ,  @code{references} , and 
 @code{code pieces} .  
 
The printed representation of an object depends on its type.  
 
For  an   @code{integer} :   If  the   @code{integer}  is negative, the printed
representation  is  preceded  by  a  minus sign (-); if non negative,
no sign is  printed.   Then  comes  the  decimal
representation  of the absolute  value  of  the   @code{integer} .
Slashification does not affect the printing of  @code{integers} .  
 
For  a   @code{flonum} :  The printed representation is preceded by a
sign ( @code{+}  or -), then a digit zero ( @code{0} ),a decimal point 
@cindex decimal point

( @code{.} ),  and  the  fraction part 
@cindex fraction part
 which is a sequence of decimal
digits.  Number of digits in the fraction part is specified by
the value of the symbol @code{digits}.  Then comes the
exponent part indicator (@samp{^}), sign of the exponent part ( @code{+}  or
-),  and the value of the exponent part in two decimal
digits.   Thus,  the  number  of  characters  of  the  printed
representation  of  a   @code{flonum}   is,  in  total,  @code{digits} + 7.
Slashification does not affect the printing of  @code{flonums} .  
 
For a  @code{symbol} :   If   @code{slashification}   is  off,  the  printed
representation  is  simply  the  successive  characters of the
 @code{print name}   @code{string}   of the  @code{symbol} .
If  @code{slashification}   is  on, some special characters are preceded
by  the  escape character  @code{/} .  The decision whether escape is
required  is  made  using  the  current  readtable,  i.e., the
current  value  of the  @code{symbol}  @code{readtable}.  Objects printed with
 @code{slashification}  on are always  read  back faithfully, provided
that the same readtable is used as when it is printed out.  
 
For a  @code{string} :   If   @code{slashification}   is  off,  the  printed
representation  is  simply  the  successive  characters of the
 @code{string} . If  @code{slashification}   is  on,  the string is printed
between double quotes ( @code{"} ), and double quotes inside the  @code{string} 
are duplicated.  
 
For  @code{cons}  cells:  The printed representation for  @code{cons}  cells
tends  to favor to lists, rather than dotted pairs.  It starts
with  an  open  parenthesis.  Then, the  @code{car}  of the  @code{cons}  is
printed,  and  the   @code{cdr}  of the  @code{cons}  is examined.  If it is
@code{nil},  a close parenthesis is printed.  If it is anything but a
 @code{cons} ,  then  a  space,  a  dot,  a space, and that object is
printed followed by a close parenthesis.  If it is a  @code{cons} , a
space  is  printed and the printing starts again all over from
the  point  after  the open parenthesis is printed, using this
new    @code{cons}  followed by a close parenthesis.   This  procedure  produces  the  usual  printed
representation such as those seen in this manual.  
 
For a  @code{code piece} :  The printed representation has the syntax
 @code{C#} @var{name}, where @var{name} is the name of the  @code{code piece} ,
normally the   name  of  the  function  to  which  the  @code{code piece}  is
associated.  @code{Code pieces}  are not read back in properly.  
 
For a  @code{stream} :  The printed representation has the syntax
 @code{S#} @var{name}, where @var{name} is the name of the external file
which the  @code{stream}  is connected to. When the  @code{stream}  is connected
to terminal, the @var{name} is  @code{"terminal-input"}  or  @code{"terminal-output"} .
 @code{Streams}  are not read back in properly.
 
For  other objects:  The printed representation has the syntax
@var{type} @code{#} @var{address}, where @var{type} is a character indicating
the type  of  the object ( @code{"V"}  for  @code{vectors} ,  @code{"R"}  for  @code{references} ),
and @var{address} is the decimal representation of
the  current address of the object.  The address is merely for
convenience  in discriminating two objects; the objects may be
relocated  by the garbage collector.   @code{Vectors}  and  @code{references} 
are not read back in properly.  
 


@cindex digits
@code{digits} {Variable}

The  value  of @code{digits}, which must be a positive  @code{fixnum} ,
specifies  how  many  digits  are  to  be  printed in the
fraction part of the printed representation of  @code{flonums} .
The  initial  value of @code{digits} is 7, and, thus, the length
of the printed   representation  of  a   @code{flonum}   is,
initially, 14.  

 
@cindex atomlength
@code{atomlength} @var{x} {Function}

@code{atomlength} returns   the   length   of   the   printed
representation  of  an atom @var{x}.  The printing is assumed
to  be   @code{slashified} .  If @var{x} is not an atom, an error is generated.  

 
The  following  additional feature is provided for the printed
representation  of   @code{cons}   cells; as a list is printed, @code{print}
maintains  the  length  of  the  @code{list}  so far, and the depth of
recursion  of printing  @code{lists} .  If the length exceeds the value
of  the variable @code{printlength}, @code{print} will terminate the printed
representation of the list with  @code{???}  and a close parenthesis.
If  the  depth  of recursion exceeds the value of the variable
@code{printlevel},  the  list will be printed as  @code{?} .  These features
allow  abbreviated printing  which  is concise and suppresses
detail.  


 
@cindex printlevel
@code{printlevel} {Variable}

@cindex printlength
@code{printlength} {Variable}

Values  of  these  variables are used as described above.
Their   initial   values   are  4  and  10  respectively.
Infinitely  deep  or  long  printed representation may be
obtained by setting zero to these variables.  

 
@node Reader, ReadTabl, Printer, PrtRepre
@subsection The Reader
 
The  purpose  of the reader is to accept characters, interpret
them  as  the  printed  representation  of  a Lisp object, and
return  the corresponding Lisp object.  The reader does not accept
all  the  printed representations; the printed representations
of  vectors,  references,  streams,  and code pieces are not
read  in  again.   However, the reader has many features which
are not seen in the printer.  
 
The reader  accepts  slashified  printed  representation  of
numbers,  @code{symbols} ,  @code{strings} , and  @code{conses} .   Some  special
characters  may  be defined as single character object, which
are  read  in  as  a  one  character  @code{symbol}  of that character.
Macro  characters 
@cindex macro character
  may  be defined, reading which will cause a
call  to  a  function  associated  with  that  character.  See
following sections about the  @code{readtable}  and read macros.  
 
Symbols  with the same  @code{print name}  are read as the same object.
This  is realized by keeping all the useful symbols in a table
called  the  @code{obvector}.   This  table  is organized as a hash
table   the   keys  used  are   @code{print name}  of  @code{symbols} . The
registration process to the  @code{obvector}  is called @code{interning}. 
 

@cindex obvector
@code{obvector} {Variable}

The  value  of @code{obvector} is  the  current  obvector.  An
 @code{interned}   symbol  @var{sy}  is  a top-level element of the
list which is the element of the obvector, the index of which is given by 
@example
   (@samp{} (hash (pname @var{sy})) 
      (vector-length obvector)) 
@end example

 
@cindex default-obvector
@code{default-obvector} {Variable}

Value of @code{default-obvector} is  the  initial  value  of
@code{obvector}.   All  the  predefined  symbols  are  initially
registered in this table.  

 
@cindex oblist
@code{oblist} @var{(obvector)} {Function}

@code{oblist}  returns   a   list   of  symbols  registered  in
@var{obvector}.   The  default  value  of  @var{obvector}  is the
current  value of the symbol @code{obvector}.  The list is newly
created each time when this function is called.  

 
@cindex intern
@code{intern} {Variable}

The  value  of @code{intern} is the  @code{interning}  function used by
the  reader,  which  must  be a function of one argument.
When a character sequence which is to be interpreted as a
symbol   is  encountered,  the  Lisp  reader  calls  this
function  with one argument, the string consisting of the
characters  of  that sequence.  The result of reading the
symbol will be the result of this function.  

The  initial  value of @code{intern} is the function @code{intern} (see
below).  Any user-defined name table management principle may  be 
established  by binding @code{intern} to a user-defined
 @code{interning}  function.  

 
@cindex intern
@code{intern} @var{string (obvector)} {Function}

@code{intern} searches @var{obvector}
for a  @code{symbol}  which has the  @code{print name}  @code{string-equal}
to  @var{string}.  If it is found, @code{intern} returns that
 @code{symbol} ;  if  not,  a new symbol with its  @code{print name}  being
@var{string}   is  created,  registered  in  @var{obvector},  and
returned  as  the value of @code{intern}.  The default value for
@var{obvector} is the current value of the symbol @code{obvector}.  

 
@cindex intern-soft
@code{intern-soft} @var{string (obvector)} {Function}

@code{intern-soft} works  almost the same as @code{intern} except that
it  does not create a new  @code{symbol} .  @var{obvector} is searched
for a  @code{symbol}  with the  @code{print name}  @code{string-equal} to
@var{string}.   If  it  is  found, a list beginning with that
 @code{symbol}  is returned; if  not  found, @code{nil} is
returned.  

 
@cindex remob
@code{remob} @var{symbol (obvector)} {Function}

@code{remob} searches  @var{obvector}  for  a  @code{symbol}  which is @code{eq} to
@var{symbol}.   If found, it is removed from the table making
it  hidden from the Lisp reader; if not, nothing is done.
It  returns  @code{nil}  as  its  value.   The  default value of
@var{obvector} is the current value of the symbol @code{obvector}.  
 
 
@node ReadTabl, SetRdTbl, Reader, PrtRepre
@subsection The Readtable
 
The  reader  is controlled by a vector called the @code{readtable}.
A  @code{readtable}  is a vector consisting of 256  @code{fixnum}  elements,
the  index @var{n} element of which corresponds to the character of
ASCII code @var{n}, and indicates the nature of the character.  
 
Currently, only lower 16 bits of each element are used.  Their
meanings  and  the initial values in the default readtable are
as follows:  
 
@table @code

@item  @code{0x0000001} 
  (LSB) means that this character is an ordinary
alphabetic character.  All the usual characters have this
bit on and others off.  


@item  @code{0x0000002} 
  means  that  this  character  is  an  extended
alphabetic character.  This bit is currently not used.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000004} 
   means   that   this  character  is  a  digit.
Characters "0" through "9" has this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000008} 
  means  that this character is a sign. "@code{+}" and
"@code{-}" has this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000010} 
  is   @code{alternate meaning}  bit.  This bit is used
in several ways.  For example, "@code{-}" has this bit on, while
it is off for "@code{+}".  
 

@item  @code{0x0000020} 
  means  the escape character.  " @code{/} " has this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000040} 
  means that this character should be slashified
in a  @code{symbol} .  Characters with special meaning have this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000080} 
  means that this character should be slashified
when   appeared   at  the top  of  a  @code{symbol} .   Special
characters, signs, and digits have this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000100} 
 means string quote character.  Double quote has
this bit on.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000200} 
 means macro character.  The macro definition (a
function  with  no  argument)  is  in  the  corresponding
position of the macrotable.  
 

@item  @code{0x0000400} 
 means right parenthesis, " @code{)} ".  
 

@item  @code{0x0000800} 
 means dotted pair dot, ".".  
 

@item  @code{0x0001000} 
 means left parenthesis, " @code{(} ".  
 

@item  @code{0x0002000} 
  means  blank  and  alike,  which  is  normally
skipped between lexical elements.  
 

@item  @code{0x0004000} 
 means a single character object.  
 

@item  @code{0x0008000} 
  means  that this character terminates a symbol
or  a  number.   All the special characters have this bit on.  
@end table
 
The  @code{macrotable}  is  used  to  hold  the definition of macro
characters.   The  definition  should  be  a  function  of  no
argument,  the  result of which is returned as the object read
in.  
 

@cindex readtable
@code{readtable} {Variable}

@cindex macrotable
@code{macrotable} {Variable}

Values  of @code{readtable} and @code{macrotable} are  the  current
readtable and the macrotable, respectively.  The initial
value  of  these  variables  are  the  same  as  those of
@code{default-readtable}  and @code{default-macrotable}, respectively  (see
below).  User defined readtable or macrotable may be used
by binding these variable to certain values.  

 
@cindex default-readtable
@code{default-readtable} {Variable}

@cindex default-macrotable
@code{default-macrotable} {Variable}

Value  of  these variables are the standard readtable and
the standard  @code{macrotable}  
@cindex standard macrotable
 of the system.  

 
 
@node SetRdTbl, , ReadTabl, PrtRepre
@subsection Setting Readtable
 
Characters may be defined as a macro character by the function
@code{readmacro}. When the  reader encounters a macro character in
the  input  text, a function associated with that character is
called.   The result of the function is returned as the return
value of @code{read}.  


 
@cindex readmacro
@code{readmacro} @var{char fn (readtable) (macrotable)} {Function}

@var{char}  is  defined  as a macro character associated with
@var{fn}.    This  definition  is  done  in  @var{readtable}  and
@var{macrotable}  given  as  arguments.   If they are absent,
current values of @code{readtable} and @code{macrotable} are assumed.  
 
Example: s   The  macro  character  "'"  could  have  been defined by  
@example
   (readmacro (character "'")
     (function (lambda nil (list (quote quote) (read)))))
@end example
Note  that  this  works  not only for (read) but also for
(read  @var{some-stream});   the  latter  binds  the  variable
@code{standard-input} to  @var{some-stream},  making  (read) in the
definition of the read macro input from that stream.  
 
If  the  backquote  character " @code{`} " never be typed in from
certain terminal, an alternative character, say, " @code{%} ", may
be settled for backquote macro by
@example
   (readmacro "%" (vref macrotable 96))
@end example
 96 is the ASCII code for " @code{`} ".  

 
Predefined read macros are quote "'", backquote " @code{`} ", and comma
" @code{,} ".  See Chapter 10, "Macros", for backquote and comma.  
 
Characters  may  be defined as single character objects.  When
the  reader  encounters  one  of  them  (except  when  reading
characters  in  a  string),  then  it is read as an  @code{interned} 
single  character  @code{symbol} , regardless of preceding or following
characters.   Single  character  objects 
@cindex single character object
 may be defined by the
function @code{single-character}.  

 

@cindex single-character
@code{single-character} @var{char (readtable)} {Function}

@var{char}  is  defined  as  a  single  character  object  in
@var{readtable}.   If  @var{readtable}  is  not supplied, current
value of @code{readtable} is assumed.  
 
Example:   
@example
   (single-character "&")
@end example
From then on, 
@example
   a&nil&b
@end example
will be read as 5 symbols, @code{a}, @code{&}, @code{nil}, @code{&},and @code{b}.  
 

@node InputFun, OutFunct, PrtRepre, InandOut
@section Input Functions
 
Functions   described   in  this  section  bind  the  variable
@code{standard-input} to  the  argument @var{stream}, before reading any
character  in.   Thus,  input is always performed on @code{standard-input}
stream.   The  default value of @var{stream} is the current
value of @code{standard-input}.  


 
@cindex read
@code{read} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{read} reads in one printed representation of a Lisp object
from @var{stream}, and returns it as its value.  

 
@cindex readline
@code{readline} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{readline} reads the current line, from current position 
@cindex current position
 to
the  line  end,  and  return  a  string consisting of the
characters  read  in.   The next character input from the
stream will be the first character on the next line.  

 
@cindex skipline
@code{skipline} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{skipline}  works  the  same  as  @code{readline} except  that it
returns @code{nil}, instead of a string.  

 
@cindex current-line
@code{current-line} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{current-line} returns  the  current line of @var{stream} as a
string   object.    Returned   string  includes  all  the
characters  in  the current input line, regardless of the
current  character  position.   The character position is not affected.  
Notice that this function only reads the current buffer contents of
@var{stream} and never updates the @var{stream}. The line which is spread 
over two buffers is not read by @code{current-line}.

 
@cindex tyi
@code{tyi} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{tyi}  inputs  one  character from @var{stream} and returns its
code as a  @code{fixnum} .  

 
@cindex tyipeek
@code{tyipeek} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{tyipeek}  returns  the  next  character  of @var{stream}.  The
difference  with @code{tyi} is that @code{tyipeek} does not advance the
current    character   position   of   @var{stream}.    Thus,
consecutive calls of @code{tyipeek} will result the same.  

 
@cindex readch
@code{readch} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{readch} is  the  same  as  @code{tyi},  except  that, instead of
returning  a  character  as  a   @code{fixnum} ,  it  returns an
 @code{interned}   symbol 
@cindex interned symbol
  the  print-name  of  which  is a one-
character string of the character read in.  

 
 
@node OutFunct, Formatted, InputFun, InandOut
@section Output Functions
 
The  functions  in  this  section  first  bind  the  variable
@code{standard-output} to  the  argument @var{stream}, before any actual
output.   Thus,  output operations are always performed on the
@code{standard-output} stream.  The default value for @var{stream} is the
current value of the symbol @code{standard-output}.  
 


@cindex prin1
@code{prin1} @var{x (stream)} {Function}

@code{prin1}  outputs  the  printed  representation  of  @var{x}  to
@var{stream},  with   @code{slashification} .  The value of @code{prin1} is
@var{x}.  

 
@cindex print
@code{print} @var{x (stream)} {Function}

@code{print} works  the  same  as  @code{prin1},  except  that @code{print}
terminates the current line after printing out.  

 
@cindex princ
@code{princ} @var{x (stream)} {Function}

@code{princ}  is  the  same as @code{prin1} except that the printing is
done without  @code{slashification} .  

 
@cindex tyo
@code{tyo} @var{char (stream)} {Function}

@code{tyo}  outputs the character whose ASCII code is specified by
@var{char} to @var{stream}. @code{tyo} returns @var{char} as its value. 

 
@cindex terpri
@code{terpri} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{terpri}  terminates  the current line of @var{stream}.  @code{terpri}
returns @code{nil} as its value.  

 
@cindex flush
@code{flush} @var{(stream)} {Function}

@code{flush} flushes out the contents of buffer of @var{stream} and 
returns @code{nil}. In general, output of newline character flushes out
 @code{stream} .


@cindex tab
@code{tab} @var{n (stream)} {Function}

@code{tab} will  set  the character position of @var{stream} at the
column  @var{n}.   If  the current character position is less
than  @var{n}, spaces are printed out until the column @var{n} is
reached;  if the current position exceeds the column @var{n},
the  line is terminated and @var{n} spaces are put out on the
next line. @code{tab} returns @code{nil} as its value.  

 
@node Formatted, Indented, OutFunct, InandOut
@section Formatted Printing
 
It  is often required to print  Lisp objects in the midst of
a  certain  message.   For  example, given a symbol @var{sy} and a
number @var{num}, one might require such an output as
@example
     "The symbol @var{sy} appeared @var{num} times." 
@end example
with @var{sy} and @var{num} varying time to time.  Of course, this can
be achieved by 
@example
     (progn (princ "The symbol ") 
            (prin1 @var{sy})
            (princ " appeared ")
            (prin1 @var{num})
            (princ " times.")
            (terpri))
@end example
but this looks ugly and not readable.  
 
This  kind  of  output  is  required  so often that the system
provides formatted printing facility 
@cindex formatted printing facility
.  
 

@cindex format
@code{format} @var{pattern . args} {Macro}

@code{format}  is  a  macro  for  formatted printing.  The first
argument  @var{pattern}  is  a  string  specifying the output
format  and the rest of the arguments @var{args} is a list of
forms   which   are   evaluated  and  used  according  to
@var{pattern}.  
 
The  string  @var{pattern}  is normally printed out as it is.
However,  when  a  slant  character  ( @code{/} )  is encountered,
printing   is   controlled  by  the  directive  character
immediately  following  it.   If  the directive character
requires   arguments,   values   of   @var{args}   are   used
sequentially  from  left  to  right.   Control  directive
characters 
@cindex control directive character
  currently available
and their meanings are as
follows:  
@table @code 

@item  @code{s} 
  prints one Lisp object with  @code{slashification} .  

@item  @code{c} 
  prints one Lisp object without  @code{slashification} .  

@item  @code{b} 
   prints  one character the code of which is supplied
as an argument.  

@item  @code{g} 
  pretty-prints one Lisp object.  

@item  @code{t} 
  tabulates to the column specified by the argument.  

@item  @code{n} 
  terminates the current line.  

@item  @code{/} 
  prints " @code{/} ".
@end table 
Case of directive characters is ignored.  

Example:   The former example is printed by 
@example
  (format "The symbol /s appeared /s times./n" @var{sy num})
@end example

 
@node Indented, , Formatted, InandOut
@section Indented Printing
 
Printed   representations  of Lisp object  are  not  easily
examined  by  human  eyes,  especially  when  parentheses  are
densely  nested.   The  indented  printer 
@cindex indented printer

@code{prind} will help you
producing   more   readable   outputs  by  giving  appropriate
indentation.  
 


@cindex prind
@code{prind} @var{x (width) (asblock) (level) (length)} {Function}

@var{x}  is  printed  with certain indentation.  @var{width} is the maximum
width for printing, the default value of which is the line length of the 
current output stream.  When  @var{asblock}  is  non @code{nil},  then the 
print out will be more  compact than when it is @code{nil} (the readability may 
be somewhat  damaged).   The  default  value of @var{asblock} is @code{nil}.  
When  @var{level}  and  @var{length} arguments are supplied, they should  
be  non negative   @code{fixnums} , and when they are non zero, the maximum level 
and length of printing lists will be @var{level} and @var{length}, 
respectively.  @code{quote} forms such as (quote  a) are  printed as 
 @code{'a} .  Moreover,  when  the  value of the variable @code{usebq} is non 
@code{nil}, backquotes and commas are used for printing @code{cons} and
@code{list} forms; (list a 'b c)} is printed as \sexpr{`(,a b ,c),
(cons 'a b)} as \sexpr{`(a .  ,b)
 
@code{prind} returns  @code{nil}  as  its  value,  unlike @code{print} which
returns its first argument.  

 
@cindex usebq
@code{usebq} {Variable}

When the value of @code{usebq} is non @code{nil}, backquotes and commas
are used in the print out of @code{prind}.  The initial value of
@code{usebq} is @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex pp
@code{pp} @var{funcname} {Macro}

The  definition  of  the  symbol @var{funcname} is printed so
that  the definition will be recovered when the print out
is read in and evaluated.  Usual functions are printed as
@example
   (defun @var{funcname lambda-list . body})
@end example
Macros defined using @code{defmacro} are printed as 
@example
   (defmacro @var{funcname lambda-pattern . body})
@end example
Other macros are printed as 
@example
   (macro @var{funcname lambda-list . body})
@end example

@chapter Code Pieces
 
A  @code{Code piece}  
@cindex code piece
 is a Lisp object which contains machine language
instructions and some Lisp objects which are accessed from the
code.  Though  @code{code pieces}  may itself be used as functions, it
is  usually more convenient to use their names, i.e., symbols,
as functions.   @code{Code pieces}  are either predefined by UtiLisp32
or obtained by compiling lambda forms.  
 
A  @code{code piece}  has its name, which is normally a function  @code{symbol} 
associated with that  @code{code piece} .  
 

@cindex funcname
@code{funcname} @var{code} {Function}

@code{funcname} returns the name of @var{code}.  

 
Number  of  arguments  for a  @code{code piece}  may be restricted to
reside  in some range.  The minimum and the maximum numbers of
arguments  are  stored somehow in the code pieces for run time
checking, and may be examined by the following functions.  

 
@cindex minarg
@code{minarg} @var{code} {Function}

@cindex maxarg
@code{maxarg} @var{code} {Function}

@code{minarg} and @code{maxarg} return  the  minimum and the maximum
number of arguments for @var{code}, respectively.  The values
returned  by  these  functions may not always be precise.
However, it is guaranteed that an error is generated when
@var{code}  is  applied  to less arguments than the result of
@code{minarg}  or  more  than  the  result of @code{maxarg}. If @var{code}
allows arbitrarily many arguments, @code{maxarg} returns -1.  

 
A  @code{code piece}  may be constructed by the following function.  
 

@cindex load-code
@code{load-code} @var{x} {Function}

@code{load-code} constructs and returns a  @code{code piece}  specified by
the argument @var{x}, which has the syntax 
@example
   (@var{name maxarg machine-code quoted})
@end example
where @var{name} is the name of the function, @var{maxarg} is the
maximum  number  of  arguments of the function, @var{machine-code}
is a list of  @code{fixnums}  each of which represents one
half word  (16 bits in Suns, 8 bits on Vaxen)  of the machine code, and,
finally, @var{quoted}  is  a  list  of  Lisp objects accessed from the
machine code.  
 この関数はUtiLisp/Cではサポートされていない. 

@cindex program-load
@code{program-load} @var{c-library} . @var{funcs} {Macro}

 Cのライブラリに含まれるCの関数をLispの関数として利用する. 
@var{funcs}は 
(Lispの関数名 Cの関数名 引数の型のリスト nil 返り値の型)
の形式をしたリストである. 型としては, fix, float, stringが指定できる.

The  Lisp  compiler 
@cindex compiler
 is a program which translates
interpretive 
@cindex interpretive

functions,  which  have  the form of lists, into machine codes
which  are  directly  executed  by the hardware.  The merit of
compilation 
@cindex compilation
  is  that the execution speed will be considerably
improved.  
 
 
@node CompFun, Declare, , Compile
@section Compiling Functions

@cindex compile
@code{compile} @var{. function-names} {Macro}

The  compiler is evoked by simply applying the macro @code{compile} as 
@example
  (compile . @var{function-names})
@end example
where  @var{function-names} is  a list of symbolic atoms the
definitions of which are @code{lambda} expressions.  The definition of
these   @code{symbols}  will  be  replaced  by the compiled code 
@cindex compiled code
.
@code{compile} returns the list @var{function-names} as its value.  

Example:  Interpretive functions @code{f} and @code{g} are compiled by:  
@example
  (compile f g)
@end example

 
@cindex revert
@code{revert} @var{. function-names} {Macro}

The  interpretive  definition  of  a  function  which  is
compiled  using  @code{compile} is saved in the property list of
the  function symbol as its @code{previous-definition} property.
@code{revert}  sets  the definition of the symbols in @var{function-names}
to  their @code{previous-definition} properties.  @code{revert}
returns @var{function-names} as its value.  

 
The  calling  interface of compiled and interpretive functions
are  totally  compatible.   Thus, a compiled function may call
interpretive functions and vice versa.  
 
Macro  calls  in the definition of the function being compiled
are  expanded  before the compilation.  Thus, such macros must
be defined before the compilation.  
 
Usually,  the compiler generates various run time check codes.
When   the   program  has  been  completed  and  there  is  no
possibility  of  errors, these check codes may be superfluous.
The  following  variables  are  used  to give direction to the
compiler whether such check codes are required or not.  


 
@cindex typecheck
@code{typecheck} {Variable}

When  the  value  of  @code{typecheck}  is non @code{nil}, the compiler
generates  type  check codes; otherwise, no run time type
check  code is generated.  The initial value of @code{typecheck}
is @code{t}.  

 
@cindex ubvcheck
@code{ubvcheck} {Variable}

When  the  value  of  @code{ubvcheck}  is  non @code{nil}, the compiler
generates  check  codes for unbound 
@cindex unbound
 variables; otherwise,
unbound  variables  are  not  checked in the object code.
The initial value of @code{ubvcheck} is @code{t}.  

 
@cindex indexcheck
@code{indexcheck} {Variable}

When  the  value  of  @code{indexcheck} is non @code{nil}, the compiler
generates  check  codes  for array or string index range 
@cindex index range
;
otherwise,  no  run time  check  code  for index range is
generated.  The initial value of @code{indexcheck} is @code{t}.  

 
@cindex udfcheck
@code{udfcheck} {Variable}

When the value of @code{udfcheck} is non @code{nil}, the compiler
generates check codes for undefined function; otherwise, no run time
check code for index range is generated. The initial value of 
@code{udfcheck} is @code{t}.

 
@node Declare, StoreCO, CompFun, Compile
@section Declaration
 
Various  declarations 
@cindex declaration
  may  be required for exact compilation.
The macro @code{declare} and @code{defconst} and the function 
@code{reset-compilation-flags} are provided for such declarations.  
 


@cindex declare
@code{declare} @var{item-list indicator} {Macro}

@code{declare}  is  used  to declare that the elements of @var{item-list}
have  the  attribute  indicated  by  @var{indicator}.
Currently, the indicators used are @code{special}, @code{redefine} and
@code{fix-value}. 

 
@cindex defconst
@code{defconst} @var{var val} {Macro}

When it is evaluated by the interpreter, it has the same effect as
(@code{setq} @var{var} @var{val}).When it is compiled,
the code in which @var{vars} are replaced by @var{vals} is generated.
An error occurs when @var{var} is assigned a new value in the
context in which @var{var} is assumed a constant.


@cindex reset-compilation-flags
@code{reset-compilation-flags} @var{} {Function}

@code{reset-compilation-flags}  revokes  all  the  declarations
effected via the macro @code{declare} so far.  

 
The  compiled  object  is designed so as to use  @code{static}  
scope rule 
@cindex scope rule
 for local variables 
@cindex local variable

(authentic Lisp scope rule is  @code{dynamic} ). For exact compilation of functions
which  utilize  global variables 
@cindex global variable
, all the 
non locally referred variables 
@cindex non locally referred variable

(i.e., variables referred from functions other than
that  which  binds  the  variable)  should  be  declared to be
@code{special}.  
 
The declaration of @code{special} variables is effected by 
@example
     (declare @var{var-list} special)
@end example
where @var{var-list} is a list of non locally referred variables. 
 
Example:    When  variables  @code{x} and @code{y} are used non-locally, they
should  be  declared  special  before compiling functions
which binds them by
@example
     (declare (x y) special)
@end example
 
If a non local variable is not properly declared, the compiler
treats  the variable as a special variable; the value of a local
variable  is  stored  somewhere  on the system stack access to
which  can  only be possible from the function which binds the
variable.  
 
For  calls  to some of the predefined functions (such as @code{atom},
@code{car},  @code{cdr},  etc.), the compiler generates certain machine code
sequences  which work effectively the same as these functions.
Thus,  if  some of the predefined standard functions are to be
redefined by the user program, they should be declared by 
@example
     (declare @var{fn-list} redefine)
@end example
where @var{fn-list} is a list of the names of predefined functions
which are to be redefined.  
 
By the declaration
@example
     (declare @var{sym-list} fix-value)
@end example
you can tell the compiler that the symbols in @var{sym-list} have
only fixnum value.

@node StoreCO, DiffromI, Declare, Compile
@section Storing Compiled Objects
 
The  compiler puts the compiled code in a relocatable form (in
a  form  of  list  of  numbers  and  some Lisp objects) in the
property  list  of  the  name  of the compiled function as its
@code{compiled-code} property.   This  may be printed to a file as a
normal  Lisp  object  and  may  later  be  read back in.  This
relocatable  form  may  be  converted into machine code object
(code  piece)  by the function @code{load-code}.  The result of @code{load-code}
may be put into the definition cell of the function name
by  the  function @code{putd} (see  Chapter ~@pxref{CodePiec},"Code Pieces", for
details).  
 


Example:   If the relocatable compiled code for the function @code{f}
is  stored in the file connected to an input stream which
is the value of the variable @code{obj}, the definition of @code{f} may
be loaded by:  
@example
     (putd 'f (load-code (read obj)))
@end example
 
 
@node DiffromI, ProcSpac, StoreCO, Compile
@section Difference from the Interpreter
 
As  the  compiled object is designed so as to attain efficient
execution,   some   differences  exist  between  the  run time
behaviour of compiled codes and interpretive codes.  
 
Non local @code{go} and @code{return} in @code{prog} forms as well as non local
@code{exit} in @code{loop} forms  are  not allowed in compiled functions.
Only  available  non-local  exit structure is that provided by
@code{catch} and @code{throw}.  
 
@node ProcSpac, , DiffromI, Compile
@section Providing Space for Compiled Codes
 
Compiled  codes  are stored in an area called  @code{fixed-heap}  which
is  different from usual  @code{heap}  for ordinary Lisp objects.  When
a  large  amount  of  code should be compiled, the size of the
 @code{fixed-heap}  must be specified to be large enough.  This can be
achieved  by  supplying an optional parameter  @code{"-f"}  to the Unix
command  @code{utilisp}  as 
@example
     % utilisp -f @var{n}
@end example
where  @var{n}  is  a  number  indicating  how  many  kilobytes
should  be  provided  for  compiled objects.  The
default value of @var{n} is 64. If enough fix heap space doesn't
exist, then Lisp process abnormally terminates.
 
As  the  garbage  collector  does  not collect garbages in the
 @code{fixed-heap}    area,   re-compilation   of   functions   leaves
uncollectable  garbages.   See  Chapter ~@pxref{MMS}, "Memory Management
System", for details.

@section The Error System
 
UtiLisp32  generates an error 
@cindex error
 when some invalid operation is
tried  by  the program; for example, when the  @code{car}  of an atom
has been taken.  
 
When   an   error  is  generated,  the  value  of  the  symbol
corresponding to the kind of the error is examined.  The value
is  interpreted  as  a function, which is called by the system
with  one argument; it depends upon the kind of the error what
this argument is.  The initial value for these symbols are the
symbols  themselves.   These symbols themselves are defined as
standard  error handlers 
@cindex standard  error handler
,
which  print  an appropriate error
diagnostic  message,  the  information passed as the argument,
and  the  function  in which, or while evaluating arguments of
which, the error took place.  
 
Then  the value of the symbol @code{break} is examined, which should be
a function of no argument, and this function is then called in
the  environment  where  the error has occurred (the variables
have  the  same  values  as  when  the error took place).  The
result  of  this  function  call  will  be  the  result of the
function during the evaluation of which the error occurred.  
 


@cindex break
@code{break} {Variable}

The  value  of @code{break} is a function which is called by the
standard error handlers after printing error diagnostics.
The initial value of @code{break} is @code{break} itself.  


@cindex break
@code{break} @var{} {Function}


@code{break} first binds @code{standard-input} and  
@code{standard-output} to the streams connected to the  terminal, i.e. @code{terminal-input} 
and @code{terminal-output},  @code{readtable} and
@code{macrotable}  to  the  standard  ones, @code{prompt} to the string
 @code{"@@"} ,  and  then  enters a @code{read-eval-print} loop similar to
the  top-level  loop.  This loop may be terminated by the
  

 
@cindex unbreak
@code{unbreak} @var{. args} {Function}

@code{unbreak}  is  used  to  terminate  a @code{break} loop.  The
inner-most   @code{break}  loop  is  terminated  and  the  value
returned  by  that  @code{break}  will  be  the last argument of
@code{unbreak}.   If no @code{break} encloses an @code{unbreak} call, an error
is generated.  

 
Following  are  the  variables the values of which are used as
the  error  handlers, and, at the same time, function names of
the  standard  error  handlers.   The  initial values of these
variables  are  themselves.   The optional argument @var{where} is
interpreted as the function name where the error has occurred.
The  default  value  of @var{where} is the function from which the
error  handler  is  called.   When  an  error handler is to be
called   explicitly   (usually  by  @code{funcall}),  an  appropriate
function name should be given for this optional argument.  
 


Example:  The function @code{cadr} could have been defined as:
@example
    (defun cadr (x)
       (cond ((or (atom x) (atom (cdr x)))
              (funcall err:argument-type x 'cadr))
             (t (car (cdr x)))))
@end example
 
@cindex err:argument-type
@code{err:argument-type} {Variable}

@cindex err:argument-type
@code{err:argument-type} @var{x (where)} {Function}

@code{err:buffer-overflow} {Variable}

@cindex err:buffer-overflow
@code{err:buffer-overflow} @var{dc (where)} {Function}

A  string or a symbol is read in which is longer than the
string  buffer 
@cindex string  buffer
.   The  size  of  the  string  buffer  is,
currently, 512 characters.  @var{dc} is always @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex err:catch
@code{err:catch} {Variable}

@cindex err:catch
@code{err:catch} @var{tag (where)} {Function}

@code{throw} was called with its first argument being @var{tag}, but
the  corresponding  @code{catch}  with  its first argument @code{eq} to
@var{tag} was no found.  

 
@cindex err:end-of-file
@code{err:end-of-file} {Variable}

@cindex err:end-of-file
@code{err:end-of-file} @var{stream (where)} {Function}

@cindex err:function
@code{err:function} {Variable}

@cindex err:function
@code{err:function} @var{x (where)} {Function}

@var{x}  was used as a function but is illegal as a function,
i.e., a non-symbolic atom or a  @code{cons}  cell which is not a @code{lambda}
expression.  

 
@cindex err:go
@code{err:go} {Variable}

@cindex err:go
@code{err:go} @var{tag (where)} {Function}

A @code{go} form was evaluated with @var{tag} but the corresponding
@code{prog} that has the label @var{tag} in its body was not found. 

 
@cindex err:index
@code{err:index} {Variable}

@cindex err:index
@code{err:index} @var{index (where)} {Function}

@var{index}  was  used  as an index for a vector or a string,
but is out of index range or not even a  @code{fixnum} .  

 
@cindex err:io
@code{err:io} {Variable}

@cindex err:io
@code{err:io} @var{stream (where)} {Function}

@var{stream} was used for some I/O operation but has not been
opened properly; an input stream was used for output, the
reverse case, or @var{stream} was not open at all.  

 
@cindex err:number-of-arguments
@code{err:number-of-arguments} {Variable}

@cindex err:number-of-arguments
@code{err:number-of-arguments} @var{dc (where)} {Function}

too few.  @var{dc} is always @code{nil}.  

 
@cindex err:open-close
@code{err:open-close} {Variable}

@cindex err:open-close
@code{err:open-close} @var{stream (where)} {Function}

diagnostic  message,  besides that of the Lisp system, is
printed out by the operating system.  

 
@cindex err:read
@code{err:read} {Variable}

@cindex err:read
@code{err:read} @var{dc (where)} {Function}

The  character  sequence read in cannot be interpreted as
a Lisp object.   This  error  is  often  caused  by an
improper usage of dots ( @code{.} ).  

 
@cindex err:return
@code{err:return} {Variable}

@cindex err:return
@code{err:return} @var{dc (where)} {Function}

@code{return}, @code{exit}, or @code{unbreak} was called but the corresponding
@code{prog}, @code{loop}, or @code{break} was not found. @var{dc} is
always @code{nil}. 

 
@cindex err:unbound-variable
@code{err:unbound-variable} {Variable}

@cindex err:unbound-variable
@code{err:unbound-variable} @var{var (where)} {Function}

@var{var} was evaluated but is unbound.  

 
@cindex err:undefined-function
@code{err:undefined-function} {Variable}

@cindex err:undefined-function
@code{err:undefined-function} @var{fn (where)} {Function}

@var{x} was used as a variable but is not a symbol.  

 
@cindex err:zero-division
@code{err:zero-division} {Variable}

@cindex err:zero-division
@code{err:zero-division} @var{dc (where)} {Function}

Division  by zero was attempted.  This error may occur in
both  integer  and  floating arithmetics.  @var{dc} is always @code{nil}.  

 
Two  special  errors  are handled quite differently.  They are
the  overflow  of  the system  stack 
@cindex system  stack
 and the shortage of the
available  memory.   When a stack overflow occurs, or when the
garbage   collector   failed  to  collect  enough  memory  for
computation,  a  diagnostic message indicating the kind of the
error  is  printed,  all the variables recover their top-level
values, and UtiLisp32 resumes the top-level loop.  
 
When  a stack overflow occurs during a garbage collection, UtiLisp32
prints out a message and the Lisp session is terminated
abnormally,  since  such  a situation is fatal and recovery is
impossible.  
 
@node AttenHan, Debugger, ErrorSys, ErrDebug
@section Attention Handling
 
When  the  execution of a Lisp program is interrupted from the
terminal  (usually  by the break key), the attention interrupt
handler attention interrupt
handler}  is  called.   If  the  system is during a certain I/O
operation,  this  call will be postponed until the termination
of that I/O.  
 


@cindex attention-handler
@code{attention-handler} {Variable}

The value of @code{attention-handler} is the attention interrupt

@cindex attention interrupt

handler,  which  must  be a function of no argument.  The
initial value of @code{attention-handler} is @code{break}.  

 
 
@node Debugger, LLDebug, AttenHan, ErrDebug
@section The Debugger
 
The  debugger is a collection of functions which are useful in
debugging 
@cindex debugging
   Lisp   programs.  
As  debugger  is  designed  for
interpretive functions, it is recommended to debug programs in
interpretive  form  and  then  compile them into machine codes
(see Section~@pxref{Compile},"Compilation", for details).  


 
@cindex trace
@code{trace} @var{. funcnames} {Macro}

@code{trace} takes arbitrarily many arguments which are names of
interpretive   functions.    The   functions   listed  in
@var{funcnames} become  @code{traced}  
@cindex traced
; the function  name  and
arguments  are  printed  on entry to these functions, the
name  and the result of the function are printed on exit,
with the nesting level, in appropriate indention.  

 @code{Tracing}   is  effected  by  automatically  rewriting the
definition  of  the   @code{traced}  functions.  This alteration
can be restored by the function @code{untrace}.  


@cindex trace-when
@code{trace-when} @var{pred . funcnames} {Macro}

@code{trace-when} is the same as @code{trace} except that tracing is
conditional.   The  form  @var{pred} is evaluated each time a
function  listed  in  @var{funcnames}  is  called,  and  that
function  call  will be  @code{traced}  if and only if the value
of  evaluating  @var{pred}  is  non-@code{nil}.  As arguments to the
function  are  already  bound  when  @var{pred} is evaluated,
@var{pred} may depend upon the arguments.  


@cindex untrace
@code{untrace} @var{. funcnames} {Macro}

@code{untrace}  stops   @code{tracing}   of  the  functions  listed  in
@var{funcnames}.  


@cindex backtrace
@code{backtrace} @var{(n)} {Function}

With  no  argument, @code{backtrace} returns a list of the names
of all the functions which are nesting around the current
environment.   When  @var{n} is supplied, a list of the names
of only @var{n} innerly nested functions is returned.  Inside
the @code{break}  loop  of  the  standard  error  handler, this
function may be used to examine the calling sequence upto
where the error has occurred.  

 
@cindex oldvalue
@code{oldvalue} @var{(n)} {Function}

With  no  argument, @code{oldvalue} returns a list of dotted
pairs.   The   @code{car}   of  each pair is a variable which is
bound  by  lambda-binding  and  the  @code{cdr}  is its previous
value  before  the  binding.  If the variable had been in
unbound  state  before the binding, its previous value is
indicated  by the symbol @code{*UnBoundVariable*}.  The order in the list is
such  that  recently  bound variables come earlier.  When
@var{n} is supplied,  only  pairs  concerning  recent  @var{n}
bindings  are included.  This function may be used to get
information on the binding history.  

 
@cindex toplevel
@code{toplevel} {Variable}

The  value of @code{toplevel} is a function of no argument which
is  used  as  the  Lisp  top-level 
@cindex top-level
.  The initial value of
@code{toplevel} is @code{utilisp}.  


@cindex toplevel
@code{toplevel} @var{} {Function}

@code{toplevel}  first  undoes  all the variable bindings except
top-level  ones.  Then the value of the variable @code{toplevel}
is  examined.   The  value  should  be  a  function  of  no
argument,  and  this  function  is  then  called.  As the
initial  value  of  the  @code{toplevel}  is the symbol @code{utilisp},
@code{toplevel} can be used to resume the top-level loop.  

 
@node LLDebug, , Debugger, ErrDebug
@section The Low-Level Debugger
 
The  low-level  debugger 
@cindex low-level  debugger
  is  
a  collections  of  functions for
debugging  the  UtiLisp  system itself.  As they are primarily
prepared  for maintainance of the system, some of them are not
safe;  misuse of them may cause a fatal error.  They should be
used  with  proper  knowledge of the physical represenation of
various Lisp objects.  


 
@cindex address
@code{address} @var{x} {Function}

@code{address} returns  the  current memory address 
@cindex address
 
of @var{x} as a
 @code{fixnum} .   If  @var{x}  is a  @code{reference} , the address of the
vector  element  pointed by @var{x} is returned.  If @var{x} is a
 @code{fixnum} , @var{x} itself is returned.  

Note:   The  Lisp objects may be relocated by the garbage
collector,  except  for  those which are allocated in the
 @code{fixed-heap}  area.  

 
@cindex peek
@code{peek} @var{addr length} {Function}

@code{peek}  returns  a  string  which  contains  a  copy of the
machine  memory  beginning at (@code{address} @var{addr}) and
@var{length} long.  

@node MMS, USE, ErrDebug, Top
@chapter Memory Management System
 
The  memory  space  used by the UtiLisp32 is divided into
four areas.  They are: 

@table @code

@item  @code{heap} 

@cindex heap
        for usual Lisp objects 
(including symbol area)

@item  @code{fixed-heap} 
  for predefined objects and compiled codes

@item  @code{stack} 
       for control information and temporary storage

@item  @code{kernel} 
      for the system kernel
@end table
 
The  size  of  the  @code{heap}  and the  @code{fixed-heap}  and areas may be
specified  by  the  parameters  at  the initiation of the Lisp
process  (see Chapter ~@pxref{Introduc}, "Introduction", for details). 
The sizes of   the   @code{kernel}  area  is  system-defined
constants.   The size of the area available for the  @code{heap}  area is 
the maximum memory size allowed
for a user job by the operating system minus the total size of
all the other areas.  
 
When  an  object  is to be allocated, by @code{cons} for example, and
not  enough space is left in the heap area,
then the garbage collector is called.  
 
The  garbage  collector gathers all the Lisp objects which will
never  be  accessed; the memory space occupied by them becomes
reusable.   Then,  the  execution  of  the original program is
resumed.  
 
The  garbage  collector  may  also be called explicitly by
@code{gc}.  


@cindex gc
@code{gc} @var{} {Function}

@code{gc}  invokes  the garbage collector.  It returns @code{nil} as its value.  

 
Following   functions   are  for  asking  states  and  setting
parameters  of  the  memory  management  system.   The unit of
memory space used in these functions is  @code{byte}  in UtiLisp32.  
 

@cindex extendheap

@code{gctime}  returns  a   @code{fixnum}  indicating CPU time required
for @code{gc} so far.  The unit used is one 60th second.

USE  (Utilisp Structure Editor) is a structure-oriented editor
for inspecting and changing list structures, which may be Lisp
programs or data.  

One  merit  of  using USE, compared with text-oriented editors
such  as Emacs or  vi,  is that editing is done on Lisp data
structures   themselves,   rather   than   on   their  printed
representations;  USE  has  the  knowledge of the hierarchical
structure  of the edited data, and the editing commands of USE
reflect  this hierarchy.  Another merit is that the editing is
done  in  the  Lisp  environment;  arbitrary  Lisp form may be
evaluated  during  editing and currently edited structures may
also be manipulated by Lisp functions.  

USE  always manipulates a copy of the original list structure;
all the atoms in the copy are the same with the original ones,
but  all  the   @code{cons}   cells  are  newly created for the copy.
Thus, when a USE session is aborted by a @code{k} command, the
original program or data is not affected at all.  
 
@node InvokUSE, USESessi, , USE
@section Invoking USE
 
Following  macros  are used to invoke USE and, on their normal
termination, restore the edited result.  



@cindex ed
@code{ed} @var{fn} {Macro}

@code{ed} invokes  USE for editing interpretive functions.  The
 @code{definition}  of @var{fn} will be edited.  @code{ed} puts edited result
in the  @code{definition}  cell of @var{fn} on normal termination.  

 
@cindex edv
@code{edv} @var{var} {Macro}

@code{edv}  invokes  USE for editing  @code{values}  of variables.  The
 @code{value}  of @var{var} is edited.  @code{edv} sets edited result in the
 @code{value}  cell of @var{var} on normal termination.  

 
@cindex edp
@code{edp} @var{sym} {Macro}

@code{edp}  invokes  USE for editing  @code{properties}  of  @code{symbols} .  The
 @code{property  list}   of  @var{sym}  is edited, and the result will
become the new  @code{property list}  of @var{sym} on normal termination.

 
@cindex edf
@code{edf} @var{file-name} {Macro}

@code{edf} invokes USE for editing text files containing printed
representations   of   Lisp   objects.  @var{file-name}  is
evaluated   first.    Its   result   must   be  a  string
representing  the  name  of the file to be edited.  It is
often convenient to set a file name to a variable and use
that  variable  as the argument of @code{edf}, since a file name
may be quite complicated.  A string indicating the file
name  may  also  be  used directly as an argument of @code{edf},
since a string is evaluated to itself.  

What  is  edited  is  a  list  of all the objects the
printed  representations of which are stored in the file.
The  order  of the elements in the list is the same as in
the  file.   In  other  words,  an extra left and a right
parentheses  are  assumed at the beginning and at the end
of  the  file.   The  top-level elements of the result of
editing  will  be  printed  back  to  the  file on normal termination.  

Note:   Rewriting  an  external  file does not affect the
state  of  the  Lisp  objects,  even if the file contains
function  definitions  such as @code{defun} or @code{macro} forms.  The
content   of   the  file  should  be  evaluated  to  effect redefinition.  

 
@cindex edl
@code{edl} @var{loc} {Macro}

@code{edl}  invokes  USE  for  editing some data which never be
edited  by  @code{ed}, @code{edv} nor @code{edp}. @var{loc} should
be a form to  access a component of certain structure, for example,
(car @var{cons}) to access the  @code{car}  of a  @code{cons}  cell
@var{cons},
(vref @var{vec n}) to access @var{n}-th element of a vector
@var{vec}. @var{loc} is evaluated first, and its value will be edited
by USE.  The result will be put back to where it was derived
from, on normal termination.  

 
@cindex use
@code{use} @var{x} {Function}

@code{use}  is  the  USE  system  itself.  It is normally called
using above macros, but users may also call @code{use} directly.
@code{use} returns one component list of the edited result, when
the  @code{use}  session  is normally terminated; it returns @code{nil}
when it is terminated abnormally (by @code{k} command).  


@node USESessi, ScopePN, InvokUSE, USE
@section USE Session
 
USE  prompts @code{terminal-input} by "@code{?}"  when it expects a
command.   If  a  symbol  or  a  number  is typed in, it is
interpreted  as a command; otherwise, especially when you type
in  a  list,  the  list  is  interpreted  as  a  form which is
evaluated  and  the  result  is  printed.   When  the  form is
evaluated,  the symbol @code{?} is bound to the current  @code{scope}  (see
the  next  section for details).  The @code{e} command may be used to
evaluate an atom.  



@cindex e
@code{e} @var{form} {Use}

The form @var{form} is evaluated and the result is printed.  

 
Arbitrarily many commands and their operands may be typed
on  a  single  line.   They are executed sequentially, as
long  as  no error is found.  When an error is found, the
rest of the current input line will be ignored.  

Following two commands are for terminating an editor session.  


 
@cindex q
@code{q} @var{} {Use}

@code{q} (quit) terminates the current session normally. 
The edited result will be restored depending how the editor is called 
from one of the macros described in the previous secrion.

 
@cindex k
@code{k} @var{} {Use}

@code{k} (kill)  terminates the current session abnormally. 
The edited result will be merely discarded no matter how the editor
is called, and 
the  original definition, value, property list, etc.  are
not affected.  

 
@node ScopePN, PatMatch, USESessi, USE
@section Scope and Position Numbers
 
The  editor always have current  @code{scope} , which is a portion of
the  whole  Lisp object  being  edited.   The  @code{scope}  may be
nested;  the  current  scope  may be an element of its parent
scope,  and  this parent scope may again have its parent, and so on.
All  insertion,  deletion,  and  replacement are effected only
inside the current scope.  
 
When  the current scope is a list, elements in the list are
specified   by   their   positions.   A  positive   @code{fixnum}  @var{n}
represents  the @var{n}-th element.  A negative number @code{-n} represents
the  @var{n}-th  element counted from the last.  @code{1} means the first
element and @code{-1} the last.  
 
Example: s
Suppose the current scope is (a b c d e f g), then
@example
     @code{1}  @code{ means}  a @code{.} 
     @code{3}  @code{ means}  c @code{.} 
     @code{-1}  @code{ means}  g @code{.} 
     @code{-3}  @code{ means}  e @code{.} 
     @code{10}  @code{ is invalid.} 
     @code{-10}  @code{ is invalid.}   
@end example
 
@node PatMatch, PrCurSc, ScopePN, USE
@section Pattern Matching Rules
 
It  is  sometimes  desired  to  search a certain pattern of Lisp object,
without  specifying  its detail.  For example, a
form  @code{setq}ing  to  a  symbol  @code{x} may be of programmer's concern
irrespective  of  the  value  assigned.   This  example may be
expressed as (setq x ?).  

The rules of pattern matching are quite simple:  
@enumerate

@item
 A pattern matches an Lisp object @code{equal} to it.  

@item
 @code{?}  matches any Lisp object.  

@item
 @code{???}  matches any portion of a list.  
@end enumerate

Example: s
@example
  (car x)  @code{ matches}  (car x)  @code{ but not}  (car '(a b)) @code{.}  
  (car ?)  @code{ matches both}  (car x)  @code{ and}  (car '(a b)) @code{.}  
  (cons ? ?)  @code{ matches both}  (cons x x)  @code{ and}  (cons x y) @code{.}  
  (list ???)  @code{ matches both}  (list)  @code{ and}  (list x y z) @code{.}  
  (a ??? z)  @code{ matches any of}  (a z) @code{,}  (a b z) @code{, or}  (a b c d e z) @code{.} 
@end example
 
@node PrCurSc, ChangScp, PatMatch, USE
@section Printing Current Scope


@cindex p
@code{p} @var{} {Use}

@code{p}  (print)  command  prints  the  current  scope in usual
abbreviated  way.   See Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut}, "Input and Output", for
abbreviated printing.  

 
@cindex pp
@code{pp} @var{} {Use}

@code{pp} (pretty print) command prints the current scope with
appropriate indention.  See Chapter ~@pxref{InandOut}, "Input and Output",
for pretty-printing.  


@cindex level
@code{level} @var{n} {Use}

@cindex length
@code{length} @var{n} {Use}

@code{level}  and  @code{length}  commands  are used to set the maximum
printing level and length in abbreviated printing to @var{n}.
@var{n} should be a  @code{fixnum} .  

Note:   The  level  and  the  length  specified  by these
commands  are  only  effective  in  one editor session.  The
values of @code{printlevel} and @code{printlength} are not affected.

@section Changing the Scope


@cindex 
@code{} @var{n} {Use}

@cindex 
@code{} @var{-n} {Use}

@cindex 0
@code{0} @var{} {Use}

Position  numbers  themselves  are commands to change the
scope  to  the position specified.  The command @code{0} changes
the  scope  to  the  parent of the current scope, i.e.  a
list which contains the current scope as its element.  


@cindex top
@code{top} @var{} {Use}

@code{top}  command  changes the scope to the whole Lisp object
being edited.  


@cindex n
@code{n} @var{} {Use}

@code{n}  (next)  command moves the scope to the element next to
the  current scope in the parent scope.  When there is no
parent  scope or the current scope is the last element of
the parent scope, it is an error.  

 
@cindex l
@code{l} @var{} {Use}

@code{l}  (last)  command  moves  the  scope  to the element one
before the current scope in the parent scope.  When there
is  no  parent  scope  or  the current scope is the first
element of the parent scope, it is an error.  

 
@cindex w
@code{w} @var{} {Use}

@code{w} (where)  command  prints  where  the  current scope is
beginning from the top level.  

 
@node Search, InDelPar, ChangScp, USE
@section Searching


@cindex f
@code{f} @var{pattern} {Use}

@code{f} (find) command searches an Lisp object which "matches"
@var{pattern} in textual order (searches  @code{car}  before  @code{cdr} ).
Searching  is  done in the current scope only.  If one is
found,  the  scope  is changed to the Lisp object found.
The  intermediate  scopes  are  saved and can be accessed
using  the  command  "@code{0}".   If  @var{pattern} is not found, a
message is generated and the scope remains unchanged.  

 
@cindex ff
@code{ff} @var{pattern} {Use}

@code{ff} (find forward) command is the same as @code{f} command except
that the search begins in the next scope, that is after the current scope.  

 
@cindex fb
@code{fb} @var{pattern} {Use}

@code{fb} (find  backward)  command  is  the  same as @code{f} command
except  that the search is performed in reverse direction
( @code{cdr}  before  @code{car} ) and the search begins in last scope,
that is, before the current scope.
current scope.  

 
@cindex fn
@code{fn} @var{} {Use}

@code{fn} (find  next) command is the same as @code{ff} command except
that  the  same @var{pattern} is used as previous @code{f} @code{ff} or
@code{fb} command.  

 
@node InDelPar, InDelSex, Search, USE
@section Inserting and Deleting Parentheses
 
 
@cindex bi
@code{bi} @var{m n} {Use}

@code{bi} (both in) command inserts an open parenthesis at the
left  of @var{m} and a close parenthesis at the right of @var{n}.
@var{m} and @var{n} are position numbers.  

Example: 
@example
  (a b c d e)
     bi 2 4
  --> (a (b c d) e)
@end example

 
@cindex bo
@code{bo} @var{n} {Use}

@code{bo}  (both  out) command deletes the parentheses enclosing
@var{n}  which  should  be a list.  @var{n} is a position number.
It is the inverse operation of @code{bi}.  

Example: 
@example
  (a (b c d) e)
     bo 2
  --> (a b c d e)
@end example


@cindex li
@code{li} @var{n} {Use}

@code{li}  (left in) command inserts an open parenthesis at the
left of @var{n}, and a close parenthesis at the end of scope.
@var{n} is a position number.  

Example: 
@example

     li 2
  --> (a (b c d e))
@end example


@cindex ri
@code{ri} @var{n} {Use}

@code{ri}  (right in) command inserts an open parenthesis at the 
beginning of scope and a close parenthesis at the
right of @var{n}.  @var{n} is a position number.  

Example: 
@example
  (a b c d e)
     ri 2
  --> ((a b) c d e)
@end example


@cindex lo
@code{lo} @var{n} {Use}

@code{lo}  (left  out) command moves the open parenthesis of @var{n}
to  the  beginning  of  the  current  scope.   @var{n} must a
Position number which specifies a list.  

Example: 
@example
  (a (b c d) e)
     lo 2
  --> ((a b c d) e)
@end example


@cindex ro
@code{ro} @var{n} {Use}

@code{ro} (right out) command moves the close parenthesis of @var{n}
to  the  end  of  the  current  scope.   @var{n}  should be a
position number specifying a list.  

Example: 
@example
  (a (b c d) e)
     ro 2
  --> (a (b c d e))
@end example


@node InDelSex, RepSexpr, InDelPar, USE
@section Inserting and Deleting S-expressions


@cindex i
@code{i} @var{pos sexpr} {Use}

@code{i} (insert) command inserts @var{sexpr} at the right of @var{pos}.
If  @var{pos}  is  a  number, it is interpreted as a position
number.   Otherwise,  it  is interpreted as a pattern and
the  first  Lisp object found to match @var{pos} is assumed.
To  use  a number as a pattern, quote the number like @code{'3}.
In  this  case,  the quote is not included in the pattern
used for matching.  

Example: s
@example
  (a b c d e)
     i 3 x
  --> (a b c x d e)
     i b (foo bar)
  --> (a b (foo bar) c x d e)
@end example

specifying 0 for @var{pos}.  

 
@cindex a
@code{a} @var{sexpr} {Use}

@code{a} (append) command replaces the tail of the current scope
by  @var{sexpr}.   If  the current scope is atomic, the whole
scope is replaced by @var{sexpr}.  

Example: s
@example
  nil
     a (a b c)
  --> (a b c)
     a d
  --> (a b c . d)
@end example

the current scope in the parent scope.  

 
@cindex d
@code{d} @var{pos} {Use}

@code{d} (delete) command deletes @var{pos} from current scope.  The
meaning of @var{pos} is the same as in @code{i} command.  
 
Example: s
@example
  (a b c d e)
     d 3
  --> (a b d e)
     d b
  --> (a d e)
@end example

 
@cindex y
@code{y} @var{pos} {Use}

@code{y} (yank)  command  inserts an Lisp object most recently
saved  by  the editor  at  the right of @var{pos}.  What is saved is
either  the  Lisp object  deleted  using  @code{d}  command,
Lisp object  replaced  using  @code{r}  command, or the result of
evaluating a form which is typed in instead of a command.
The  meaning  of @var{pos} is the same as in @code{i} command.  This
command can be used, with @code{d} command, to move a portion of
Lisp object inside the edited structure.  

Example: s
@example
   (a b c d e)
      d 3
   --> (a b d e)
      y a
   --> (a c b d e)
      (cons 'a 'b) => (a . b)

@code{r} @var{pos expr} {Use}

@code{r} (replace) command replaces @var{pos} with @var{expr}. @var{pos}
has the same meaning as in @code{i} command.  

Example: 
@example
 (a b c d e)
    r 3 (foo bar)
 --> (a b (foo bar) d e)
@end example


@cindex ra
@code{ra} @var{pattern expr} {Use}

@code{ra} (replace all)  command replaces all Lisp object in
the  current  scope  which matches @var{pattern} with @var{expr}.

@cindex call
@code{call} @var{command-string} {Function}

This function executes @var{command-string}
and waits its termination.
Because the execution is done by a subprocess
rather than UtiLisp32 itself, 
some commands such as @code{cd} have no effect on
the status of UtiLisp32.
Return value is a  @code{fixnum} 
that represents the status of the command execution.


@cindex cd
@code{cd} @var{(dir)} {Function}

@code{cd} changes the current working directory of UtiLisp32 to @var{dir}
which must be a string.
The default value for @var{dir} is the user's home directory
defined by the HOME environment variable.


@node Environment Variables, Command Line Arguments, Calling Shell Commands, Unix Interface

the  Lisp system since its initiation.  This includes the
time  required  for  garbage  collection and for external
programs   which   are  called  using  @code{call}.
If the optional argument @var{form} is supplied,
@var{form} is evaluated again, and CPU time required for this
re-evaluation  is  returned.   The  time is returned as a
 @code{fixnum}  object in one 60th seconds.  

 
@cindex quit
@code{quit} @var{} {Function}

   ?  =>  (foo . bar)
@end example


@cindex setl
@code{setl} @var{loc val} {Macro}

@code{setl} is a macro which makes it easy to describe list structure
modification or vector element updating. It is particularly useful for
defining such macroes that access and update an element simultaneously.
@var{loc} is either a variable name or an expression which indicates the
element in list or vector. @var{val} is a value set to the place indicated
by @var{loc}. @code{setl} rerurns the value  @var{val}.
